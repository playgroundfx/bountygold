## Box 1: Firms expect production could return quickly but anticipate
sales will recover gradually

As part of the Bank of Canada’s efforts to better understand the
economy’s recovery from the COVID‑19 pandemic, we asked firms
participating in the summer 2020 Business Outlook Survey how quickly
they expect their sales, employment and production to return to pre-
COVID‑19 levels. Firms reported that, while capacity could resume
quickly as the economy reopens and containment measures are lifted, the
recovery in demand is expected to be more gradual. Across the response
categories, businesses commonly referred to elevated uncertainty
regarding future demand.

Firms’ expectations of a return in sales to pre-pandemic levels often
depend on the lifting of government-mandated restrictions. About 40
percent of businesses reported that they anticipate their sales will
fully recover by next year or that their sales were not negatively
affected by the pandemic (Chart 1-A). This set of firms also expect the
size of their workforce to be near pre-pandemic levels in one year.
These firms generally did not report recent staff layoffs or declines in
their past sales. They either sell non-cyclical goods or services or
work within long-term contracts and include manufacturers, business-to-
business services firms (e.g., providers of consulting or technology
services) and utilities. About 15 percent of businesses expect their
sales to mostly recover in the next 12 months. They are primarily in
manufacturing. Among these firms, roughly half reported a decline in
past sales and most had laid off workers.

Slightly less than half of businesses expect at most a partial recovery
in their sales over the next 12 months or report that the trajectory of
their sales is too uncertain to predict. These expectations are
concentrated among firms in the services sector, especially those in
tourism-dependent, finance or real estate industries, as well as
businesses linked to commodities, particularly energy. Most of these
firms reported declines, often significant, in their past sales and had
recently laid off workers. Many of these businesses have frozen hiring
or do not anticipate a return to previous employment levels. Some noted
they have streamlined operations, often with the use of technology, in
response to the crisis. Around a third of this group of firms said the
Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program has helped them reduce or avoid
layoffs.

When asked about production, most businesses reported they would be able
to return to normal levels within a month once restrictions are lifted
(Chart 1-B), suggesting the capacity of these firms to produce has not
been reduced. Generally, businesses in the services sector would be able
to resume full operations somewhat faster than those in the goods
sector. Services sector firms that expect a slower return to normal
production often noted that labour-related constraints would be the
reason for the delay. Some goods firms reported that it would take
longer to scale back up because of complex production processes or
logistical issues. A few businesses noted supply chain issues related to
the pandemic.
