Thank you, Minister Freeland. Good morning.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity alongside you, Minister, to
share with Canadians the renewed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework agreed upon
by the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada. This framework lays
out our shared objectives for Canada’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), while giving the
Bank the necessary operational independence to achieve these objectives.

I’d like to briefly highlight the principles that we agreed will guide
the Bank’s work over the next five years.

First, the Government and the Bank believe the best way that monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can contribute to the well-being of Canadians is to continue to
focus on price stability.

Canadians value low and stable inflation. This point came through loud
and clear during our extensive consultations in the lead up to the
renewal of this agreement. And I want to thank everyone who took the
time to share their views.

Second, the Government and the Bank agree that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should
continue to support maximum sustainable employment—that is, the highest
level of employment we can expect to achieve without seeing inflationary
pressures.

This is important because few things are more central to the economic
and financial well-being of Canadians than having a job. It’s also
central to the price stability objective because keeping inflation on
target over time requires an economy that is operating at maximum
sustainable employment.

Third, and notably, the Government and the Bank agree that well-anchored
inflation expectations are critical to achieving both price stability
and maximum sustainable employment. So the primary objective of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is to maintain low and stable inflation over time.

The flexible inflation-targeting framework we’ve had in place for 30
years has served us very well. It has delivered low, stable and
predictable inflation—consumer price index inflation has averaged very
close to 2 percent since 1991. And with this track record, Canadians
have grown to expect that the Bank will achieve the inflation target.

This has contributed to a more stable economic environment so households
and firms can make spending and investment decisions with confidence. It
has supported sustained growth in output, employment and productivity,
and it has improved Canadians’ standard of living.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the value of a clear and well-
understood inflation target. Our framework guided our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response at
the outset of this crisis, including our extraordinary liquidity
operations and use of quantitative easing. It also guided our decisions
to taper and then end quantitative easing.

And even as the complications of reopening the global economy have
caused inflation in Canada and many other countries to rise, medium and
longer-run inflation expectations in Canada have remained well anchored
on the 2 percent target. Keeping inflation expectations well anchored is
key to completing the recovery and getting inflation back to target.

As you can see, our flexible inflation-targeting framework has also
proven adaptable and resilient to changes in the economic landscape.
This renewed agreement articulates how we will continue using this
flexibility to address challenges confronting our economy. This includes
using our extended monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools when needed and actively
seeking the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price
stability when conditions warrant. And the agreement outlines how we are
considering a broader range of labour market indicators to assess full
employment and the economy’s potential output.

This agreement provides continuity and clarity, and it strengthens our
framework to manage the realities of the world we live in. This is the
framework we need now as we confront elevated inflation and the
challenges of reopening the economy. And it is what we need looking
ahead beyond the pandemic.

The Minister and I both agree, this is the right framework for Canada’s
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

I have a speech in a couple of days and will expand further on these
themes, so let me conclude here and invite your questions.
