The objective of Canada's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is to promote the economic and
financial well-being of Canadians. Experience has shown that the best
way monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can achieve this goal is by maintaining a low and
stable inflation environment. Doing so supports a strong and inclusive
labour market that provides every Canadian with opportunities for a good
quality of life.

Currently, the reopening of the global economy is associated with
elevated inflation in Canada and abroad. While this is a global
phenomenon, it makes maintaining a sound framework for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in Canada all the more important.

From a longer-term perspective, since the adoption of an inflation-
targeting framework 30 years ago, consumer price index (CPI) inflation
has averaged close to 2 percent, despite periods of both upward and
downward pressures on inflation. The maintenance of low, stable and
predictable inflation has also contributed to Canada’s strong labour
market performance. In the current context, Canada’s inflation-targeting
framework helps to ensure that inflation will return to 2 percent over
the medium term.

The Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada believe that the best
contribution of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to the well-being of Canadians is to
continue to focus on price stability. The Government and the Bank also
agree that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should continue to support maximum
sustainable employment, recognizing that maximum sustainable employment
is not directly measurable and is determined largely by non-monetary
factors that can change through time. Further, the Government and the
Bank agree that because well-anchored inflation expectations are
critical to achieving both price stability and maximum sustainable
employment, the primary objective of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is to maintain low,
stable inflation over time.

This renewal of Canada’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework is occurring at a
time when changes to the economy are complicating the task of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic have had a
significant impact on the global economy and financial system, and major
trends such as shifting demographics and new digital technologies are
altering the economic landscape. Climate change and the long-term
transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will drive structural
change in the Canadian and global economies. Also, there is now greater
recognition, supported by economic research, that when the benefits of
economic growth and opportunity are more evenly shared, it leads to more
prosperity for the whole economy. A strong and inclusive labour market
helps reduce income inequality and supports robust demand for goods and
services.

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is well equipped to address some of these challenges,
less so for others. Two developments are particularly salient to the
conduct of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/):

  * Neutral interest rates are likely to be lower than in the past, which means that central banks will have less room to lower their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rates in the face of large adverse shocks to the economy.
  * Major forces, including demographics, technological change, globalization, and shifts in the nature of work, are having profound effects on the Canadian labour market. These evolving forces have increased uncertainty about the level of maximum sustainable employment (i.e., the level of employment beyond which inflationary pressures arise).

Consequently, the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada agree to
renew the inflation target on the following basis:

  * The target will continue to be defined in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the 12-month rate of change in the total CPI.
  * The inflation target will continue to be the 2 percent mid-point of the 1 to 3 percent inflation-control range.
  * The agreement will run for another five-year period, ending December 31, 2026.

The Government and the Bank further note that:

  * Given that there is uncertainty about the maximum level of employment that is consistent with price stability, the Bank will continue to use the flexibility of the 1 to 3 percent control range to actively seek the maximum sustainable level of employment when conditions warrant.
  * The Bank will consider a broad range of labour market indicators and will systematically report to Canadians on how labour market outcomes have factored into its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions.
  * The Bank will also continue to leverage the flexibility of the 1 to 3 percent range to help address the challenges of structurally low interest rates by using a broad set of tools, including sometimes holding its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at a low level for longer than usual.
  * The Bank will utilize the flexibility of the 1 to 3 percent range only to an extent that is consistent with keeping medium-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.
  * The Bank will explain when it is using the flexibility in the framework.

The Government and the Bank acknowledge that a low interest rate
environment can be more prone to financial imbalances. In this context,
the Government will continue to work with all relevant federal agencies
to ensure that Canadian arrangements for financial [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) and
supervision are fit-for-purpose and consider changes if and where
appropriate.

Additionally, while monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) cannot directly tackle the threats
posed by climate change, the Bank will develop the modelling tools
needed to take into account the important implications of climate change
on the Canadian economy and financial system.

Finally, recognizing the limits of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Government and
the Bank also acknowledge their joint responsibility for achieving the
inflation target and promoting maximum sustainable employment.
