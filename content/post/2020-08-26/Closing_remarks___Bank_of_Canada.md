This has been a thought-provoking and productive day. It’s clear from
the discussion that we’ve made good progress in our work, and I was
pleased to hear the overall support for our approach. That said, it’s
also clear that there are perspectives yet to be considered and some
robustness checks of our model results that we will want to do.

Rather than summarizing all the ground we’ve covered here today, I’d
like to draw out some highlights and offer my first take on where our
researchers should follow up. The fact that our current inflation-
targeting framework has garnered much support over the years is
remarkable, but we recognize that it’s not perfect. We have a simple,
flexible framework that holds us accountable, and the credibility it has
brought is hard-won and invaluable.

In our morning sessions, we focused on the horse race—our side-by-side
assessment of alternative frameworks. The results that Rhys Mendes
reviewed are rich in information, and I commend our researchers for
that. Having been part of many renewals of our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
frameworks, it is evident that theory is catching up to practice.

While the models that researchers are using are still imperfect, they
are richer along important dimensions. For example, we can model
different behaviours in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of inflation expectations and the fact
that people differ in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of income and wealth. In addition, we’re
increasingly going beyond models to assess how well different frameworks
would perform in the real world.

We saw that none of the frameworks we looked at dominate across all our
criteria. However, in certain circumstances some do much better than
inflation targeting. For example, targeting the price level does a
better job of stabilizing prices when compared with our current
framework. This is particularly true given the effective lower bound
(ELB) on interest rates. That said, our experiments with real people
found that these gains may not be realized because people often
extrapolate from the past. Gains also come at the cost of worse outcomes
when stabilizing output and distributing income and wealth.

Clearly, this means we cannot have it all. We will need to make trade-
offs in our final decision on the framework with the federal government
in 2021. As a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-maker, I cannot emphasize enough how important it
is to be transparent about the trade-offs that are ultimately made. Our
horse-race approach, with clear criteria, will help us do just that.
Already, we’re better able to clarify how our current framework works in
practice. We have a single target—inflation—but we also explicitly take
the output gap into account in setting interest rates. Pierre Fortin
recognized this in his remarks relating to the Bank’s response to
COVID‑19. The horse race also shows that our flexible inflation target
is quite close to a dual mandate, in which we would target inflation and
employment. It’s therefore no surprise that the differences between the
two frameworks are relatively small.

The discussants found the results of our research plausible and
consistent with what is in the literature.

There were nonetheless some different views on which framework we should
ultimately choose. I found the discussion on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) deal with the ELB
and the low inflation environment particularly interesting. One view was
that we should raise the inflation target if we are in a low inflation
trap. We considered this in 2016 and found that the gains weren’t big
enough to make up for adverse implications for inequality and the
credibility of our target. Another solution suggested was to consider
“probing” or taking more risk that inflation could overshoot the target
when inflation is low. Without implying any commitment to this idea, I
think this approach is worth considering, particularly given the
uncertainty about how low unemployment can go before it leads to
inflation pressures.

Our discussants also raised several helpful technical points that are
worth pursuing. For instance, both Joseph Gagnon and Pierre Fortin
encouraged us to pursue alternative relationships between unemployment
and inflation—through a non-linear Phillips curve, for example, and the
degree of downward nominal wage rigidity. Stephanie Schmitt-Grohé
suggested we should look at how the means—or averages—of key variables,
such as the output gap, might change under different monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
frameworks. Of course, there is debate over whether monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
actually affects anything but the price level in the long run. Stephanie
also asked us to see if our results on inequality are robust to
different assumptions about fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

In the afternoon session, we discussed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) coordination and lessons
from the COVID-19 crisis. We have seen that when interest rates are at
or approaching the ELB, fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)—if implemented quickly—can be a
powerful force in helping to stabilize the economy. Ricardo Reis and
Marty Eichenbaum also emphasized the criticality of studying monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) frameworks in the context of the ELB and a new fiscal reality of
high debt. That is why fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interaction is one of
the key questions we are studying in conjunction with Finance Canada. I
found Ricardo’s and Marty’s comments on the fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
responses to COVID-19 interesting. They rightly raised some of the
challenges [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-makers could face going forward. As a community, we
need to be thinking about the implications of a new environment for our
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework.

Clearly, the recovery we are seeing is encouraging, but we know that it
will take time and concerted [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) efforts on many fronts to make up
the ground we’ve lost. I think it’s the right time to think about [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
build a strong economy in the post–COVID-19 world, particularly given
challenges posed by high indebtedness. Policy coordination, while
valuable, raises governance issues for central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-makers, who
have operational independence for good reason. The lessons from [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
are clear that independent central banks do a better job of controlling
inflation.

Fortunately, we have learned from [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). In Canada, we now have the
benefit of the formal inflation-control agreement between the Bank of
Canada and the federal government that is renewed every five years. The
fact that it has thrived over nearly three decades and with many changes
of government is testament to our joint commitment to our monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework and the economic well-being of Canadians. Marty
suggested that in our 2021 agreement, we look at how the fiscal
authorities could clarify their role in supporting the inflation
target—potentially through enhanced automatic stabilizers, among other
suggestions.

In our final session, we considered the lessons from the COVID-19 crisis
and the use of alternative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools. Ed Devlin has come to the same
conclusion we have—that the Bank’s new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools have helped improve
market functioning and credit intermediation. We agree that it is too
early to see how effective these tools will ultimately be in helping
achieve our inflation target.

Now, there is some evidence from other central bank experiences in
previous crises that the tools deployed at the ELB did help support the
economy and raise inflation rates. But with so much going on at the same
time, it is difficult to get good estimates. As Anil Kashyap pointed
out, it’s harder to generate growth when key parts of financial markets
are dislocated. Anil’s point about quantitative easing working through
the exchange rate in small open economies like Canada’s is consistent
with research that we’ve done. I agree with him that there are important
identification issues in trying to estimate ultimate economic impacts.

Annette Vissing-Jørgensen walked us through some potential challenges
with exiting from quantitative easing that we will want to better
understand and address. Ed’s point that purchases of corporate bonds
could create challenges for passive fixed-income funds adds to this.

I take Annette’s point that announcement effects can be powerful, so you
will understand that I won’t reflect on the comments made today
regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) strategy.

I will say, however, that the discussion only reinforced the importance
of being transparent about what we are doing and why, of commitment to
our inflation target, and of continued study and refinement of the tools
to make them as effective as possible.

Let me wrap up. The discussions today have clearly illustrated that we
are better informed than we were when we started in 2018 but that it’s
still too early for any firm conclusions. This workshop has helped
refine the road map for the work that remains to be done for 2021.

Our consultations will continue, and we will continue to solicit and
welcome feedback from a much broader set of people than in the past. You
can look forward to more events and communications from us in the months
ahead. I encourage you to keep an eye on [the special page][1] on our
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) dedicated to work on the renewal of Canada’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
framework.

Merci encore une fois de la part de mes collèges et moi-même pour une
discussion très riche.

Thank you for sharing your views today. Even after all our work over the
past two years, it is clear that there are many perspectives to be
considered. It helps us immeasurably to have you hold forth with us
here.
