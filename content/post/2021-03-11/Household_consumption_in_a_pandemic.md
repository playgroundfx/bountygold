##  What people might do with extra cash

Right now, with most of the extra savings, it seems people are:

  * saving them as deposits in personal bank accounts
  * paying down debt 
  * buying financial assets such as [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s and registered retirement savings plans 

Strong activity in the housing market suggests some people are also
trading up for more space.

If the pandemic is brought under control and households become more
confident, we might see Canadians spend some of these savings. That’s
because pent-up demand may cause an initial spike in dining out and
travel. But it’s unlikely that people will feel the need to “catch up”
and spend a lot more on services like trips to the dentist and haircuts.

When services were less available due to lockdowns, Canadians spent more
on goods. When the economy opens back up, spending habits will likely
shift to a balance between goods and services.

But it will take a while for spending to return to pre-pandemic levels.
We don’t have a clear timeline for when life will return to normal, and
key risks that could postpone this return to normalcy remain:

  * a third wave of infections and lockdowns
  * delays to the vaccine rollout
  * uncertainty around COVID-19 variants
