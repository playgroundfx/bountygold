The Bank of Canada expects all media organizations to respect the
embargo conditions for its key publications. Today, the Bank provided
the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) under embargo to trusted media that
have signed an undertaking with the Bank. Note that the Bank did not
provide embargoed access to the press release that explains the latest
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions. One media organization breached the embargo
time and published articles on two parts of the MPR: the key inputs to
the projection and the section describing the evolution of our balance
sheet.

We immediately [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)ed the organization in question and instructed
them to provide an account of the circumstances surrounding the breach.
In accordance with the Bankâ€™s media [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), this organization will not
have any further access to Bank embargos, lock-ups or media activities
for a prescribed period.
