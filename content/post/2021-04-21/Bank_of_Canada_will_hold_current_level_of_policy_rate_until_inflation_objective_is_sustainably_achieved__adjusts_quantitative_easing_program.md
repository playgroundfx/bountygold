The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank continues to provide
extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate,
reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE)
program. Effective the week of April 26, weekly net purchases of
Government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion.
This adjustment to the amount of incremental stimulus being added each
week reflects the progress made in the economic recovery.

The outlook has improved for both the global and Canadian economies.
Activity has proven more resilient than expected in the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines is progressing. A number
of regions, including Canada, are experiencing a difficult third wave of
infections and lockdowns. The more contagious variants of the virus are
straining healthcare systems and affecting hard-to-distance activities,
and have introduced a new dimension of uncertainty. The recovery remains
highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the pace of
vaccinations.

Global economic growth is stronger than was forecast in the January
Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although the pace varies considerably
across countries. After a contraction of 2 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank
now projects global GDP to grow by just over 6 ¾ percent in 2021, about
4 percent in 2022, and almost 3 ½ percent in 2023. The recovery in the
United States has been particularly strong, owing to fiscal stimulus and
rapid vaccine rollouts. The global recovery has lifted commodity prices,
including oil, contributing to the strength of the Canadian dollar.

In Canada, growth in the first quarter appears considerably stronger
than the Bank’s January forecast, as households and companies adapted to
the second wave and associated restrictions. Substantial job gains in
February and March boosted employment. However, new lockdowns will pose
another setback and the labour market remains difficult for many
Canadians, especially low-wage workers, young people and women. As
vaccines roll out and the economy reopens, consumption is expected to
rebound strongly in the second half of this year and remain robust over
the projection. Housing construction and resales are at historic highs,
driven by the desire for more living space, low mortgage rates, and
limited supply. The Bank will continue to monitor the potential risks
associated with the rapid rise in house prices. Meanwhile, strong growth
in foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected to drive a
robust recovery in exports and business investment. Additional federal
and provincial fiscal stimulus will contribute importantly to growth.
The Bank now forecasts real GDP growth of 6 ½ percent in 2021,
moderating to around 3 ¾ percent in 2022 and 3 ¼ percent in 2023.

The Bank has revised up its estimate of potential output in light of
greater resilience to the pandemic and accelerated digitalization. The
virus and lockdowns have had very different impacts across sectors,
businesses, and groups of workers, creating an unusual degree of
uncertainty about the amount of slack in the economy and how long it
will take to be absorbed. To gauge the evolution of slack, the Bank will
look at a broad spectrum of indicators, including various measures of
labour market conditions.

Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to
around the top of the 1-3 percent inflation-control range. This is
largely the result of base-year effects—year-over-year CPI inflation is
higher because prices of some goods and services fell sharply at the
start of the pandemic. In addition, the increase in oil prices since
December has driven gasoline prices above their pre-pandemic levels. The
Bank expects CPI inflation to ease back toward 2 percent over the second
half of 2021 as these base-year effects diminish, and inflation is
expected to ease further because of the ongoing drag from excess
capacity. As slack is absorbed, inflation should return to 2 per cent on
a sustained basis some time in the second half of 2022.

Even as economic prospects improve, the Governing Council judges that
there is still considerable excess capacity, and the recovery continues
to require extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain committed to
holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until
economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is
sustainably achieved. Based on the Bank’s latest projection, this is now
expected to happen some time in the second half of 2022. The Bank is
continuing its QE program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest
rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding further
adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be guided by Governing
Council’s ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the
recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation
objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June
9, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and
inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the
MPR on July 14, 2021.
