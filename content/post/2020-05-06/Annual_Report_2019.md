Let us turn now to stewardship of the Canadian economy. Amid the hype
and breathless commentary around each variation in the data, one can
lose sight of just how resilient the economy has been. That resilience
has been sorely tested over the past three years, mostly through
rhetoric and actions related to international trade. This has fostered
deep uncertainty about the future of many businesses, in Canada and
elsewhere, causing significant pullbacks in business investment and
international trade. On top of this, there was yet another downdraft in
global and especially Canadian oil prices to start 2019, deepening the
already-severe adjustments to lower prices that had been underway since
2015. Finally, 2018 had seen several new prudential measures put in
place to manage risks related to mortgages, along with several interest
rate hikes. Last year at this time, the Bank was carefully watching to
see how these developments would affect the Canadian economy,
particularly the housing market.

The global economy slowed significantly in 2019, but by year-end there
were signs that things were levelling off. Indeed, the Bank expects
global economic growth to edge slightly higher in 2020. This does not
mean that trade turmoil and related uncertainty are no longer having
negative effects: the level of global gross domestic product (GDP) is
now permanently lower than it otherwise would have been in the absence
of new trade policies. By the end of 2020, we expect the cumulative cost
to the world to approach US$1 trillion, or over 1 percent of GDP.
However, as companies adapt to the new situation, economic growth should
pick up, albeit more moderately and from a lower level of output.

Despite all this, the Canadian economy grew just a touch less during
2019 than we expected a year ago. This is because housing and related
household spending stabilized and contributed to growth, even as soft
investment and exports continued to hold back the economy’s expansion.
In other words, Canada is not immune to global trade conflict, but for
most of 2019 the negatives were offset by some positives. While many
central banks cut interest rates during 2019, rates in Canada held
steady amid these contrary forces. This prompted considerable commentary
about [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) divergence between Canada and the United States—even though
US rates have now declined to Canadian levels, having previously
diverged on the upside. Even so, Canadian mortgage rates were drawn down
in 2019 by developments in the global bond market. This helped to
support household spending and the housing market. It also served as a
reminder that Canadian households are already carrying record levels of
debt, which makes them vulnerable to future shocks. However, the new
mortgage lending rules are having their intended effect, making the
household sector more resilient to future developments.

> Inflation is on target and has been there for most of the past two
years—a significant achievement in light of the turbulence the economy
has been through.

All this to say that the Canadian economy is in a good place overall,
even if it is not in a good place everywhere. For one thing, we would
prefer a more sustainable situation with more growth in exports and
investment and more moderation in housing and household indebtedness. We
would also prefer that the economy be better balanced regionally. Given
continuing adjustments to low oil prices and ongoing transportation
constraints, oil-producing regions of Canada continue to struggle
relative to the rest of the country. Over [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), it has been rare for
all regions and all sectors of the Canadian economy to be expanding at
the same time. Today’s conditions are in many ways the reverse of what
we saw from 2008 to 2014, when oil prices and the Canadian dollar were
high and conditions outside the oil-producing regions were challenging.
In other words, even if the economy is roughly where it belongs, it is
not true for every region or for every individual. There is work yet to
be done—adjustments are ongoing, and confidence remains soft.

The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that inflation is on target and has been there for most
of the past two years—a significant achievement in light of the
turbulence the economy has been through. Maintaining low and stable
inflation is the central tenet of our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework, delivering
financial stability to all Canadians and a well-functioning real economy
and labour market. Today, unemployment is near its all-time low. In the
past seven years, unemployment rates have fallen significantly across
all age groups, even as labour force participation has risen. Overall,
the economy is operating close to full capacity, with evidence of slack
only in certain regions and specific sectors. In other words, the
macroeconomy has made it home, after more than 10 years of difficult
adjustments.
