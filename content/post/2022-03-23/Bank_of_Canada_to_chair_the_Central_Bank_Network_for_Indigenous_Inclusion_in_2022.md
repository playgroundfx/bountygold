The Bank of Canada announced today it has officially begun a one-year
term as chair of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion
(CBNII).

The CBNII was [established last year][1] by the Bank of Canada, Te Pūtea
Matua (Reserve Bank of New Zealand), the Reserve Bank of Australia and
the U.S. Federal Reserve to foster ongoing dialogue and raise awareness
of Indigenous economic and financial issues.

The Network also plans a bi-annual Symposium on Indigenous Economies.
The [first symposium][2] was hosted by the Bank of Canada in November
2021, in partnership with the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics and
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

In 2021, under the leadership of the RBNZ, the Network focused on
building awareness of members’ respective economic and Indigenous
histories.

“As the Bank of Canada assumes the role of chair, we have an important
opportunity to support the growth and evolution of the network, and to
deepen both the relations that have been developed and our understanding
of the challenges and opportunities in the Indigenous Economy,” said
Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri. “We look forward to building upon the
sterling work done by Te Pūtea Matua, which served as the Network’s
inaugural chair in 2021.”
