Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and committee members. Senior Deputy
Governor Wilkins and I welcome the opportunity to appear before you to
discuss the Bank’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions in response to the coronavirus
pandemic, as well as our _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR), which we
published yesterday.

The Canadian economy is experiencing a significant and rapid
contraction. The shock is a global one, affecting all countries, but
commodity-producing countries like Canada are being hit twice. Beyond
the impact of the necessary public health measures to contain the virus,
the economy is also being hurt by the plunge in world oil prices.

In the very near term, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-makers can do little more than cushion the
blow. Indeed, for the Bank to achieve its primary mandate of keeping
inflation close to target, the economy first needs to be stabilized. In
recent weeks, Governing Council lowered our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate three
times to 0.25 percent, which we consider to be its effective lower
bound. These moves were based on analysis of the factors we could
measure immediately—mainly the likely fallout on the economy from the
collapse in oil prices as well as the immediate effects of measures to
contain the coronavirus. This preliminary analysis indicated that
cutting rates all the way to the effective lower bound was the best
contribution the Bank could make to stabilizing the economy and
complementing the government’s extensive efforts to respond to the
pandemic.

However, for the Bank’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions to reach companies and
households and foster a robust recovery, it is crucial that financial
markets function well. And so, the Bank has so far taken many steps
aimed at improving market functioning. Let me describe these programs
and facilities and their intended purpose.

The market for Government of Canada bonds is foundational—it forms the
basis for many other financial markets. So we launched a program to
purchase at least $5 billion of these bonds per week to support the
liquidity and efficiency of this market. In yesterday’s announcement, we
stressed that we can increase this program at any time, should
conditions warrant it. And we announced that we will increase our
participation in the federal government’s treasury bill auctions to 40
percent of each new issue.

The Bank is also helping ensure proper functioning of provincial debt
markets by buying up to 40 percent of new provincial money market
securities and up to $50 billion of provincial government bonds.

We have taken a number of steps to ensure financial institutions have
ample liquidity so Canadian businesses and households can continue to
have access to credit to meet their basic needs and bridge this
difficult period.

These steps include enhanced repo facilities—which allow banks and other
primary dealers to borrow cash from us by using their assets as
collateral—in order to help them better manage their liquidity risks. We
have expanded the list of institutions that can access our lending as
well as the types of collateral they can pledge, and these facilities
can now provide funding for up to 24 months. We have started a
contingent term repo facility, which offers liquidity to a broader range
of counterparties that are active in the repo market. Further, we have
established a program to buy Canada Mortgage Bonds—up to $500 million
per week. This is to support the healthy functioning of an important
market for mortgage lending to Canadians. Together, all these facilities
should improve liquidity and funding conditions for lenders, which will
help companies and households have access to the credit they need. It
will also help them benefit more from our monetary stimulus during the
recovery period.

To support Canadian businesses, we started a program to buy bankers’
acceptances, which are a key source of financing for many small and
medium-sized companies. We also began the Commercial Paper Purchase
Program, which provides financing for a wide range of businesses and
public authorities. And yesterday, we announced a program to buy $10
billion of high-quality corporate bonds in the secondary market.

As we said in our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement yesterday, the Bank stands ready
to augment the scale of any of its programs should market conditions
warrant it. With these programs in place, the combination of aggressive
fiscal action by governments and monetary stimulus by the Bank will
create the best possible foundation for the recovery period.

It is the normal practice for the Bank to provide a detailed economic
forecast for the Canadian economy in our MPR and for us to discuss this
forecast when we appear before this committee. However, the economic
outlook is highly conditional on how long the containment measures
remain in place and how households and businesses adapt. Given this, the
Bank decided that it would be false precision to offer a specific
forecast in our MPR. Instead, we chose to offer two plausible
illustrative scenarios for the economy. One should be thought of as a
“best case”—which remains feasible depending on the length of the
shutdown and other factors—while the other is a much more severe
scenario. Many possible outcomes lie between these two. Regardless of
the outcome, based on the Bank’s analysis, we concluded that substantial
monetary stimulus needs to be in place to lay the foundation for the
post-containment economic recovery.

I want to stress that all our actions so far have been entirely
consistent with our inflation-targeting framework as set out in the
agreement with the federal government. Inflation targets provide an
anchor for the economy—particularly inflation expectations—and a guide
for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions. Keeping inflation close to our 2 percent target
means setting monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to stabilize the economy and returning
economic growth and employment back to full capacity.

Before I conclude, let me just note that this is the last time that I am
scheduled to appear before this committee as Governor of the Bank of
Canada. These appearances are an important part of the Bank’s
accountability to Canadians. I have always appreciated these occasions
to explain our work to you and, through you, to the public. And I thank
you for your work in this regard.

With that, Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I would be happy to take
your questions.
