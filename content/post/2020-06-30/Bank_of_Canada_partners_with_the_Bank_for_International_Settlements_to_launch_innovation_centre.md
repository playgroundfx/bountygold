The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Bank of Canada
announced today they will be launching a BIS Innovation Hub centre to
advance fintech innovation within the central banking community. The
centre will open in Toronto within two years and is one of four
locations scheduled to open in North America and Europe.

This partnership will advance the Bank’s understanding of the digital
economy and the technological transformation of financial services. It
builds on the Bank’s [existing research and collaboration][1] with
partners in the central bank and technology communities on digital
currencies and fintech.

“We’re proud to host a BIS innovation centre in Toronto and to
strengthen our collaboration with other central banks and the private
sector on digital technologies,” said Bank of Canada Governor Tiff
Macklem. “This partnership will allow the Bank to continue its work on
behalf of Canadians to explore how technology will shape the future of
our economy and financial system.”

 “Toronto is an ideal location for a regional BIS innovation centre,”
said Eric Santor, Advisor to the Governor on Digitalization. “The centre
will be well-placed to identify key technology trends and contribute to
the development of innovative solutions to benefit and enhance the
global financial system.”
