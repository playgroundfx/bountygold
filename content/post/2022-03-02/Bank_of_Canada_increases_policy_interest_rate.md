The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to
½ %, with the Bank Rate at ¾ % and the deposit rate at ½ %. The Bank is
continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of
Government of Canada bonds on its balance sheet roughly constant until
such time as it becomes appropriate to allow the size of its balance
sheet to decline.

The unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a major new source of
uncertainty. Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply.
This will add to inflation around the world, and negative impacts on
confidence and new supply disruptions could weigh on global growth.
Financial market volatility has increased. The situation remains fluid
and we are following events closely.

Global economic data has come in broadly in line with projections in the
Bank’s January _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR). Economies are emerging
from the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 more quickly than
expected, although the virus continues to circulate and the possibility
of new variants remains a concern. Demand is robust, particularly in the
United States. Global supply bottlenecks remain challenging, although
there are indications that some constraints have eased.

Economic growth in Canada was very strong in the fourth quarter of last
year at 6.7%. This is stronger than the Bank’s projection and confirms
its view that economic slack has been absorbed. Both exports and imports
have picked up, consistent with solid global demand. In January, the
recovery in Canada’s labour market suffered a setback due to the Omicron
variant, with temporary layoffs in service sectors and elevated employee
absenteeism. However, the rebound from Omicron now appears to be well in
train: household spending is proving resilient and should strengthen
further with the lifting of public health restrictions. Housing market
activity is more elevated, adding further pressure to house prices.
Overall, first-quarter growth is now looking more solid than previously
projected.

CPI inflation is currently at 5.1%, as expected in January, and remains
well above the Bank’s target range. Price increases have become more
pervasive, and measures of core inflation have all risen. Poor harvests
and higher transportation costs have pushed up food prices. The invasion
of Ukraine is putting further upward pressure on prices for both energy
and food-related commodities. All told, inflation is now expected to be
higher in the near term than projected in January. Persistently elevated
inflation is increasing the risk that longer-run inflation expectations
could drift upwards. The Bank will use its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools to
return inflation to the 2% target and keep inflation expectations well-
anchored.

The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is the Bank’s primary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instrument. As the
economy continues to expand and inflation pressures remain elevated, the
Governing Council expects interest rates will need to rise further. The
Governing Council will also be considering when to end the reinvestment
phase and allow its holdings of Government of Canada bonds to begin to
shrink. The resulting quantitative tightening (QT) would complement
increases in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate. The timing and pace of further
increases in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate, and the start of QT, will be guided by the
Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving
the 2% inflation target.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
April 13, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR at
the same time.
