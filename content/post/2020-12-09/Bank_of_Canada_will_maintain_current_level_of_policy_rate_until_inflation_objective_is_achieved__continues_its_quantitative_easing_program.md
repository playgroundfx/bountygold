The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent
and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its
extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its
quantitative easing (QE) program, which continues at its current pace of
at least $4 billion per week.

The rebound in the global and Canadian economies has unfolded largely as
the Bank had anticipated in its October _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR).
More recently, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the development of effective vaccines is
providing reassurance that the pandemic will end and more normal
activities will resume, although the pace and breadth of the global
rollout of vaccinations remain uncertain. Near term, new waves of
infections are expected to set back recoveries in many parts of the
world. Accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and financial conditions are continuing to
provide support across most regions. Stronger demand is pushing up
prices for most commodities, including oil. A broad-based decline in the
US exchange rate has contributed to a further appreciation of the
Canadian dollar.

In Canada, national accounts data for the third quarter were consistent
with the Bank’s expectations of a sharp economic rebound following the
precipitous decline in the second quarter. The labour market continues
to recoup the jobs that were lost at the start of the pandemic, albeit
at a slower pace. However, activity remains highly uneven across
different sectors and groups of workers. Economic momentum heading into
the fourth quarter appears to be stronger than was expected in October
but, in recent weeks, record high cases of COVID-19 in many parts of
Canada are forcing re-imposition of restrictions. This can be expected
to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2021 and contribute to a
choppy trajectory until a vaccine is widely available. The federal
government’s recently announced measures should help maintain business
and household incomes during this second wave of the pandemic and
support the recovery.

CPI inflation in October picked up to 0.7 percent, largely reflecting
higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. While this suggests a
slightly firmer track for inflation in the fourth quarter, the outlook
for inflation remains in line with the October MPR projection. Measures
of core inflation are all below 2 percent, and considerable economic
slack is expected to continue to weigh on inflation for some time.

Canada’s economic recovery will continue to require extraordinary
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. The Governing Council will hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is
absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved.
In our October projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To
reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield
curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well
underway and will adjust it as required to help bring inflation back to
target on a sustainable basis. We remain committed to providing the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the
inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
January 20, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR at the same time.

Subsequent to the Bank’s [previously announced][1] review of the
publication time of its interest rate announcements, the Bank re-
confirms that it will remain at 10:00 (ET). As announced, starting in
January the target for the overnight rate will take effect on the
business day following each rate announcement.
