The Bank of Canada is now the administrator of the Canadian Overnight
Repo Rate Average (CORRA) and will post today the first rate calculated
using an improved methodology. The Bank publishes this important
Canadian interest rate benchmark on its [[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)][1] at no cost and as a
public good. The Bank is also committed to ensuring that CORRA is:

  * a robust, reliable and representative measure of the secured overnight funding rate,
  * readily available for use globally as a key Canadian interest rate benchmark, and
  * [aligned][2] with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.

“The publication of CORRA by the Bank today is an important milestone in
the collaborative efforts between the Canadian financial industry and
the Bank to reform interest rate benchmarks and make financial markets
even safer,” said Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Toni Gravelle. “We
expect that over time CORRA will become the dominant Canadian benchmark
used across a wide range of financial products.”

Information on the calculation methodology, publishing process, [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
use and governance structure for CORRA is available on the [Bank
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)][3], along with a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data series. CORRA is still
available to users through various data distributors and existing
infrastructure.

To prepare for this new role, the Bank worked closely with the
[Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada][4], which
provides the data that the Bank is using to calculate CORRA. The Bank
also worked closely with industry participants through the [Canadian
Alternative Reference Rate Working Group][5] and its subgroups.
