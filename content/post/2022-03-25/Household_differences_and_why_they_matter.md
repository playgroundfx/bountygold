## The pandemic’s uneven impact on households

Most people who could work from home during the pandemic kept their jobs
and saw little or no interruption to their income. Meanwhile, public
health measures to contain the virus severely affected some
services—like restaurants, accommodation, travel and entertainment. Many
people in these sectors lost income. The impact was most severe for low-
wage workers, especially women and young people.

The effects of the pandemic on employment have been larger and more
unequal than those of past recessions. Still, many households across
income groups are emerging from the crisis with improved financial
health. This is due to the extraordinary supports that were available
during the pandemic as well as limited opportunities to spend during
lockdowns. The strong recovery of the labour market overall has also
been an important factor.

Despite these positive developments, however, important risks remain.
These include relatively high household debt levels and high inflation.

In fact, because inflation is high and the economy is running at full
capacity again, in early March we raised our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate and said we
expect it will need to rise further. Throughout that process, we’ll be
watching developments related to household finances closely, thanks to
the data and tools that have been useful during the pandemic.
