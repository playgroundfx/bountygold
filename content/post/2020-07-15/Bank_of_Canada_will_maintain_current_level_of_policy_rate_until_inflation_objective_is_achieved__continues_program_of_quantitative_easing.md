The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly
½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank is also continuing
its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases
of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds. The
Bank’s short-term liquidity programs announced since March to improve
market functioning are having their intended effect and, with reduced
market strains, their use has declined. The provincial and corporate
bond purchase programs will continue as announced. The Bank stands ready
to adjust its programs if market conditions warrant.

While economies are re-opening, the global and Canadian outlook is
extremely uncertain, given the unpredictability of the course of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting this, the Bank’s July _Monetary Policy
Report_ (MPR) presents a central scenario for global and Canadian growth
rather than the usual economic projections. The central scenario is
based on assumptions outlined in the MPR, including that there is no
widespread second wave of the virus.

After a sharp drop in the first half of 2020, global economic activity
is picking up. This return to growth reflects the relaxation of
necessary containment measures put in place to slow the spread of the
coronavirus, combined with extraordinary fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support. As a result, financial conditions have improved. The prices of
most commodities, including oil, have risen from very low levels. In the
central scenario, the global economy overall shrinks by about 5 percent
in 2020 and then grows by around 5 percent on average in 2021 and 2022.
The timing and pace of the recovery varies among regions and could be
hampered by a resurgence of infections and the limited capacity of some
countries to contain the virus or support their economies.

The Canadian economy is starting to recover as it re-opens from the
shutdowns needed to limit the virus spread. With economic activity in
the second quarter estimated to have been 15 percent below its level at
the end of 2019, this is the deepest decline in economic activity since
the Great Depression, but considerably less severe than the worst
scenarios presented in the April MPR. Decisive and necessary fiscal and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions have supported incomes and kept credit flowing,
cushioning the fall and laying the foundation for recovery. Since early
June, the government has announced additional support programs, and
extended others.

There are early signs that the reopening of businesses and pent-up
demand are leading to an initial bounce-back in employment and output.
In the central scenario, roughly 40 percent of the collapse in the first
half of the year is made up in the third quarter. Subsequently, the Bank
expects the economy’s recuperation to slow as the pandemic continues to
affect confidence and consumer behaviour and as the economy works
through structural challenges. As a result, in the central scenario,
real GDP declines by 7.8 percent in 2020 and resumes with growth of 5.1
percent in 2021 and 3.7 percent in 2022. The Bank expects economic slack
to persist as the recovery in demand lags that of supply, creating
significant disinflationary pressures.

CPI inflation is close to zero, pulled down by sharp declines in
components such as gasoline and travel services. The Bank’s core
measures of inflation have drifted down, although by much less than the
CPI, and are now between 1.4 and 1.9 percent. Inflation is expected to
remain weak before gradually strengthening toward 2 percent as the drag
from low gas prices and other temporary effects dissipates and demand
recovers, reducing economic slack.

As the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to
require extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. The Governing Council
will hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until
economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is
sustainably achieved. In addition, to reinforce this commitment and keep
interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its
large-scale asset purchase program at a pace of at least $5 billion per
week of Government of Canada bonds. This QE program is making borrowing
more affordable for households and businesses and will continue until
the recovery is well underway. To support the recovery and achieve the
inflation objective, the Bank is prepared to provide further monetary
stimulus as needed.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
September 9, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR on October 28, 2020.
