* Seven central banks and the BIS release a report assessing the feasibility of publicly available CBDCs in helping central banks deliver their public [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) objectives.
  * Report outlines foundational principles and core features of a CBDC, but does not give an opinion on whether to issue.
  * Central banks to continue investigating CBDC feasibility without committing to issuance.

A group of seven central banks together with the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) today published a report identifying the foundational
principles necessary for any publicly available CBDCs to help central
banks meet their public [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) objectives.

The report, [_Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles
and core features_][1], was compiled by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of
England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal
Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank and the BIS, and
highlights three key principles for a CBDC:

  * Coexistence with cash and other types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system.
  * Any introduction should support wider [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) objectives and do no harm to monetary and financial stability.
  * Features should promote innovation and efficiency.

The group of central banks will continue to work together on CBDCs,
without prejudging any decision on whether or not to introduce CBDCs in
their jurisdictions.

“This report is a real step forward for this group of central banks in
agreeing the common principles and identifying the key features we
believe would be needed for a workable CBDC system. As well as helping
central banks to meet their public [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) objectives, the report
provides a useful framework for how central banks provide money and
support payment systems in an ever-evolving digital world. This group of
central banks has built a strong international consensus which will help
light the way as we each explore the case and design for CBDCs in our
own jurisdictions,” said working group co-chair Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy
Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Committee on Payments
and Market Infrastructures.

Based on these principles, the group has identified the core features of
any future CBDC system, which must be:

  * Resilient and secure to maintain operational integrity.
  * Convenient and available at very low or no cost to end users.
  * Underpinned by appropriate standards and a clear legal framework.
  * Have an appropriate role for the private sector, as well as promoting competition and innovation.

“A design that delivers these features can promote more resilient,
efficient, inclusive and innovative payments. Although there will be no
‘one size fits all’ CBDC due to national priorities and circumstances,
our report provides a springboard for further development of workable
CBDCs,” said working group co-chair Benoît Cœuré, Head of the BIS
Innovation Hub.

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said: “International cooperation is
essential to improve the quality of CBDCs and to ensure that they also
support efficient and low-cost cross-border payments. We still have a
lot of work to do before deciding to issue a CBDC in Canada. As we
investigate this, we welcome engagement from the private sector and
civil society since our CBDC would have to meet the needs of all
Canadians.”

Further development of CBDCs requires a commitment to practical [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
analysis and applied technical experimentation. While this has already
started, the speed of innovation in payments and money-related
technologies requires the prioritisation of collaborative
experimentation.

“While technology is changing the way we pay, central banks have a duty
to safeguard people’s trust in our money. Central banks must complement
their domestic efforts with close cooperation to guide the exploration
of central bank digital currencies to identify reliable principles and
encourage innovation. The present report is a convincing proof of this
international cooperation,” said Christine Lagarde, President of the
European Central Bank, who chairs the group of central bank governors
responsible for the report.

Future activities will include exploring other open questions around
CBDCs and the challenges of cross-border payments, as well as continuing
outreach domestically and with other central banks to foster informed
dialogue on key issues. Work by the [BIS Innovation Hub][2], which
serves the broader central banking community, will contribute to this
objective.
