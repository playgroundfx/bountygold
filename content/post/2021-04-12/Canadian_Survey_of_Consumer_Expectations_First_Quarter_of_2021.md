## Household finance, credit and house prices

**Consumers expect their spending growth to pick up despite flat income
growth (Chart 5).** This increase in spending growth expectations to a
survey high could reflect pent-up demand for some goods and services as
well as improved confidence about the end of the pandemic (Box 1). The
gap between expectations for spending and expectations for income has
expanded to its widest point since the survey began. This suggests that
households could become more confident in their spending after the
pandemic has subsided and may be willing to spend some of their
accumulated savings. In fact, respondents anticipate spending more than
one-third of their extra savings accumulated during the pandemic over
the coming two years. People also expect to use about 15 percent of
their extra savings to pay down debt.

Consumers’ expectations for interest rates at all horizons changed
little and are lower than they were before the pandemic. This decline in
expectations is in line with the Bank’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate cuts and forward
guidance; it also supports planned household spending (Chart 6).

**The pandemic has not significantly altered consumers’ ability to make
debt payments.** Consumers’ views on access to credit are less positive
than before the pandemic, indicating tighter credit conditions. Still,
most people reported being able to make debt payments on time, and only
a small faction (9 percent) have requested debt payment deferral for
mortgages or consumer credit. The vast majority of these requests—made
because of a pandemic-related decline in household income or for
precautionary reasons—were partly or fully approved.

**Consistent with the strength in housing markets, consumers’
expectations for house price gains moved up (Chart 7).** This increase
since the outbreak has been widespread across the country, but
expectations are more moderate in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Low mortgage
rates, increased savings and pandemic-induced shifts in behaviour
continue to boost demand for housing. Buyers prefer larger homes and
locations outside of city centres. Roughly 10 percent of respondents (14
percent of renters and 9 percent of homeowners) plan to buy or are
considering buying a house or a condominium.
