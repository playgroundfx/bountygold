## Demand has improved outside of high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) services

Nearly two‑thirds of firms indicated their sales have reached or
exceeded pre-pandemic levels—an increase from the winter survey and a
sign that the recovery is broadening further (Chart 2). Half of
businesses reported that the second wave of containment measures and
lockdowns had a smaller or no adverse impact on their sales compared
with the first wave. Firms noted that this is largely because they
themselves—and their customers—have adapted to the evolving crisis. For
example, businesses now have greater capacity for more online sales,
staff are set up and familiar with remote work, and cleaning and
physical distancing protocols are in place.

With uncertainty having receded and vaccination rollouts continuing,
firms’ indicators of future sales have strengthened again (Chart 3). For
many businesses, demand from domestic and foreign customers—particularly
from the United States—has improved from a year ago. Firms’ sales
outlooks are also supported by low interest rates and a shift in
consumer preferences to products and services that make it easier for
Canadians to stay at home and reduce [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) with others. For example,
firms tied to housing and household goods (such as those that provide
construction, financial and real estate services, as well as building
materials, appliances and food) commonly reported that their sales
indicators are up from already solid levels. Business service providers
are also seeing stronger demand, sometimes as firms change their ways of
doing business during the pandemic (e.g., adopting new digital platforms
and applications). Exporters linked to commodities also noted that
demand has improved, albeit from subdued levels.

Still, the negative effects of the pandemic continue to weigh heavily on
sales prospects for an important group of businesses. One‑fifth of firms
do not expect their sales to return to pre‑pandemic levels in the next
12 months. Most of these firms are tied to high‑[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) services, such
as businesses in tourism and in pockets of non‑essential retail. Some of
these firms indicated their sales outlooks have slightly improved, but
from a period of extremely weak demand. A few businesses remain
uncertain about their sales outlooks because the evolution of the
pandemic is still unclear.
