The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to
1%, with the Bank Rate at 1¼% and the deposit rate at 1%. The Bank is
also ending reinvestment and will begin quantitative tightening (QT),
effective April 25. Maturing Government of Canada bonds on the Bank’s
balance sheet will no longer be replaced and, as a result, the size of
the balance sheet will decline over time.

Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine is causing unimaginable human
suffering and new economic uncertainty. Price spikes in oil, natural gas
and other commodities are adding to inflation around the world. Supply
disruptions resulting from the war are also exacerbating ongoing supply
constraints and weighing on activity. These factors are the primary
drivers of a substantial upward revision to the Bank’s outlook for
inflation in Canada.

The war in Ukraine is disrupting the global recovery, just as most
economies are emerging from the impact of the Omicron variant of
COVID-19. European countries are more directly impacted by confidence
effects and supply dislocations caused by the war. China’s economy is
facing new COVID outbreaks and an ongoing correction in its property
market. In the United States, domestic demand remains very strong and
the US Federal Reserve has clearly indicated its resolve to use its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools to control inflation. As [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus is
withdrawn, US growth is expected to moderate to a pace more in line with
potential growth. Global financial conditions have tightened and
volatility has increased. The Bank now forecasts global growth of about
3½% this year, 2½% in 2023 and 3¼% in 2024.

In Canada, growth is strong and the economy is moving into excess
demand. Labour markets are tight, and wage growth is back to its pre-
pandemic pace and rising. Businesses increasingly report they are having
difficulty meeting demand, and are able to pass on higher input costs by
increasing prices. While the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and
circulate, high rates of vaccination have reduced its health and
economic impacts. Growth looks to have been stronger in the first
quarter than projected in January and is likely to pick up in the second
quarter. Consumer spending is strengthening with the lifting of pandemic
containment measures. Exports and business investment will continue to
recover, supported by strong foreign demand and high commodity prices.
Housing market activity, which has been exceptionally high, is expected
to moderate.

The Bank forecasts that Canada’s economy will grow by 4¼% this year
before slowing to 3¼% in 2023 and 2¼% in 2024. Robust business
investment, labour productivity growth and higher immigration will add
to the economy’s productive capacity, while higher interest rates should
moderate growth in domestic demand.

CPI inflation in Canada is 5.7%, above the Bank’s forecast in its
January _Monetary Policy Report (MPR)_. Inflation is being driven by
rising energy and food prices and supply disruptions, in combination
with strong global and domestic demand. Core measures of inflation have
all moved higher as price pressures broaden. CPI inflation is now
expected to average almost 6% in the first half of 2022 and remain well
above the control range throughout this year. It is then expected to
ease to about 2½% in the second half of 2023 and return to the 2% target
in 2024. There is an increasing risk that expectations of elevated
inflation could become entrenched. The Bank will use its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tools to return inflation to target and keep inflation expectations
well-anchored.

With the economy moving into excess demand and inflation persisting well
above target, the Governing Council judges that interest rates will need
to rise further. The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate is the Bank’s primary monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) instrument, and quantitative tightening will complement increases
in the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate. The timing and pace of further increases in the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the
economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% inflation target.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June
1, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and
inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on July 13,
2022.

A market notice providing operational details for QT will be published
this morning on the Bank’s web site.
