Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins has informed the Bank’s Board
of Directors that her last day at the Bank will be December 9, 2020.

“It has been an honour to serve Canadians as Senior Deputy Governor of
the Bank of Canada. I am immensely proud of what our team has
accomplished over the years, and especially these past months to restore
market functioning and support households and business during the
pandemic,” said Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins. “The end of the year
provides for an appropriate time for me to leave the Bank, so that I can
explore the next chapter in my career. It also enables Governor Macklem
and the Board to move forward in solidifying the team that will manage
the economy through recovery and achieve the longer-term goals of the
Bank. I know that the Bank is in excellent hands.”

Governor Macklem thanked Ms. Wilkins for her service to Canadians as
Senior Deputy Governor, and throughout her career at the Bank, “Carolyn
has provided exceptional leadership as an economic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)maker these
past six and a half years. As Senior Deputy Governor, she has also
strengthened our research, enhanced our diversity, and expanded our
digital capacity. While she will be sorely missed, her many
contributions will be felt by all of us for many years to come. On
behalf of her colleagues on Governing Council, the Board, and everyone
at the Bank, we wish her the very best and know she will make her mark
in whatever she chooses to do next.”
