## Diversity and inclusion are good for the economy

A more inclusive economy is a bigger economy—a more prosperous economy
with room to grow without creating inflationary pressures.

Drawing more workers from diverse communities into the labour market is:

  * good for workers
  * good for business
  * good for the whole economy 

But the COVID-19 pandemic has had very uneven economic effects. Low-wage
earners, women, youth and racialized Canadians have borne the brunt of
job losses because they work in the hardest-hit sectors.

A complete economic recovery is a shared one, with good job
opportunities for everyone—including those who have been hurt the most.

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is a broad macroeconomic instrument. We can’t use it to
target specific groups. But what we can—and must—do is keep the benefits
of inclusion in mind while implementing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
