The Bank of Canada, the [Bank of England][1], the [Bank of Japan][2],
the [European Central Bank][3], the [Federal Reserve][4], and the [Swiss
National Bank][5] are today announcing a coordinated action to further
enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar
liquidity swap line arrangements.

To improve the swap linesâ€™ effectiveness in providing U.S. dollar
funding, these central banks have agreed to increase the frequency of
7-day maturity operations from weekly to [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/). These [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) operations
will commence on Monday, March 23, 2020 and will continue at least
through the end of April. The central banks also will continue to hold
weekly 84-day maturity operations.

The swap lines among these central banks are available standing
facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains
in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of
such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both
domestically and abroad.
