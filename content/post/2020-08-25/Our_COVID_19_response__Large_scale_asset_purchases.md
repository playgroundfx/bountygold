# Our COVID-19 response: Large-scale asset purchases

The Bank of Canada has taken many actions to support Canadians since the
COVID-19 pandemic struck. These include large-scale asset
purchasesâ€”buying a substantial amount of government bonds and other
financial assets. Our purchases serve two purposes. They help key
financial markets work properly, and they can help increase spending in
the economy. This leads to more employment and stronger economic growth.
