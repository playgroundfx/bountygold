## Box 1: Consumer-oriented firms reported a collapse in sales due to
COVID‑19

To better understand the quickly evolving economic impacts of COVID‑19,
the Bank conducted phone consultations with a small, targeted sample of
Canadian firms and industry associations between March 13 and 17. The
impact of the shock on firms was still escalating, with some firms
seeing very recent sharp declines in demand and others only expecting
them.

Businesses in the accommodation, food services and recreation industries
reported that their sales, orders and reservations had collapsed.
Several firms had already closed or expected to soon close their
operations due to declining cash flow. Non-food retailers reported a
dramatic drop in foot traffic and were scaling down their operations.
Businesses in these industries were drastically laying off staff or
reducing staff hours in line with operations. However, some were also
pivoting to new or less-developed business lines, such as food delivery
and online sales, as a way to mitigate the negative effect on revenue.

Some manufacturers anticipated reduced demand from challenged customers.
At the time of the consultations, they expected to temporarily shut down
their operations and reduce their workforces. While some businesses in
other industries (such as those tied to housing construction) had not
yet been affected, most respondents indicated significantly more
uncertainty about the demand for their products and services.

In contrast, grocery retailers and related transportation services noted
that their sales had reached unprecedented levels. They expected some of
the surge to last as people continue to eat at home (instead of dining
out) and purchase more cleaning products.

Beyond weak demand, several businesses also said that the availability
of some inputs, often from China and Italy, had been disrupted. Some
firms mentioned that their access to Chinese-sourced inputs was
gradually resuming. Retailers, particularly grocery stores, noted that
they had not had significant issues with their supply chains.

Finally, when asked about their upcoming capital expenditures, firms
generally reported taking a wait-and-see approach. Almost all firms in
hard-hit tourism-related and food services were cutting back on
renovations and purchases of machinery and equipment or were placing
investment plans on hold to preserve cash. Some firms in other sectors
had not yet changed their investment plans since they had large
investment projects already underway or had not intended to make new
investments over the coming year.
