Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and committee members. Senior Deputy
Governor Wilkins and I welcome the opportunity to appear before you to
discuss the Bank of Canada’s actions in response to the coronavirus
pandemic.

Since the pandemic began, the Bank has had two goals in mind. In the
short term, we have been working to help Canadian households and
businesses bridge the crisis period. Our longer-term goal is to provide
a strong foundation for economic recovery.

Both of these goals require a well-functioning financial system to
ensure the success of the extraordinary fiscal response that has been
put in place. So, let me talk about our actions that are aimed at
financial-market functioning. Then I will discuss our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
response.

The Bank acted rapidly and forcefully over the past couple of months to
implement several programs and facilities aimed at supplying needed
liquidity and supporting core financial markets. This effort was crucial
to keep credit flowing to households and businesses so they could
continue to meet their basic needs.

These programs include our ongoing weekly purchases of at least $5
billion of Government of Canada bonds to support the liquidity and
efficiency of this foundational market. We have increased our
participation in the federal government’s treasury bill auctions. We are
also helping ensure the proper functioning of provincial debt markets by
buying new provincial money market securities and provincial bonds in
the secondary market.

We have taken a number of steps to ensure financial institutions have
reliable access to ample liquidity. These steps include enhanced repo
facilities—which allow banks and other primary dealers to borrow cash
from us by using their assets as collateral. This helps financial
institutions better manage their liquidity risks. We have expanded the
list of institutions that can access our lending as well as the types of
collateral they can pledge, and these facilities can now provide funding
for up to 24 months.

Further, we have established a program to buy Canada Mortgage Bonds—up
to $500 million per week. This is to support the healthy functioning of
an important market for mortgage lending to Canadians. Together, all
these facilities should improve liquidity and funding conditions for
lenders, which will help businesses and households access the credit
they need. It will also help Canadians benefit more from our monetary
stimulus during the recovery period.

To ease strains in key funding markets for Canadian companies, we
started programs to buy bankers’ acceptances and commercial paper. And
we have just begun a program to buy $10 billion of high-quality
corporate bonds in the secondary market.

We reported on the early results from these programs in our _Financial
System Review_ , which we published earlier this month. To summarize, we
have succeeded in restoring good functioning to many key financial
markets that had been showing signs of significant stress. We can see
that bid-ask spreads and yield spreads in many markets have narrowed
significantly. Access to liquidity for financial institutions has
greatly improved. And many of our programs to support financial markets
are being used less and less as conditions stabilize.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Bank has reduced its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest
rate by a total of 150 basis points to 0.25 percent—the effective lower
bound. We took these actions based on our analysis of the factors we
could see right away—the impact of measures to contain the spread of
COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices. It is worth noting that even if
Canada had not seen a single case of COVID-19, the economy would have
required increased monetary stimulus because of the fallout from lower
oil prices.

The reduction in our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate is entirely consistent with the
inflation-targeting agreement under which we operate. We know that to
bring inflation back to the target, it is necessary to stabilize the
economy and then return economic output and employment to their
potential. Lowering our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to the effective lower bound is the
best contribution we can make at this time to complement the
government’s fiscal efforts and lay the groundwork for the eventual
recovery.

We know that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will have less ability to deliver stimulus
right now, given that much of the economy is either shut down or
activity is significantly reduced. However, the combination of
aggressive fiscal action by governments and monetary stimulus by the
Bank, supported by our actions to ensure well-functioning financial
markets, will create the best possible foundation for the recovery
period.

In closing, let me emphasize that there is considerable uncertainty
about the future course of the pandemic. The Bank is prepared to augment
the scale of any of its programs if needed to support market
functioning. And if further monetary stimulus is required to meet our
inflation targets, the Bank has tools available to deliver that
stimulus.

With that, Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I would be happy to take
your questions.
