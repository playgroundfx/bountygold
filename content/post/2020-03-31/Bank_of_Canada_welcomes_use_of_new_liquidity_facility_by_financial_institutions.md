The Bank of Canada today welcomed the move by a number of Canadian
banks, including the six largest, to draw on its new Standing Term
Liquidity Facility (STLF).

“It is good to see Canada’s banks using this new standing facility,”
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen S. Poloz said. “It was designed to be
used, and their participation shows that this facility is a helpful
addition to our liquidity tool kit. I encourage all eligible Canadian
banks to access the STLF to maintain the flow of credit to Canadian
households and businesses.”

The Canadian Bankers Association [issued a statement][1] saying that
nine banks, including Canada’s six largest, had all accessed the STLF.

Under the STLF, eligible financial institutions can borrow from the Bank
of Canada by pledging a broad set of collateral, including mortgages.
This improves their ability to fund new lending. The STLF is one of
several facilities the Bank of Canada has put in place to address
potential liquidity issues.

The Bank of Canada is [acting in several ways][2] to support the economy
and financial system. The Bank of Canada stands ready to take any and
all actions we can to protect the well-being of Canadians during this
difficult time.
