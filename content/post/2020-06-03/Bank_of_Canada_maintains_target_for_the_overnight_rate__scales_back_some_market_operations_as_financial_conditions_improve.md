The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly
½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent.

Incoming data confirm the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
global economy. This impact appears to have peaked, although uncertainty
about how the recovery will unfold remains high. Massive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
responses in advanced economies have helped to replace lost income and
cushion the effect of economic shutdowns. Financial conditions have
improved, and commodity prices have risen in recent weeks after falling
sharply earlier this year. Because different countries’ containment
measures will be lifted at different times, the global recovery likely
will be protracted and uneven.

In Canada, the pandemic has led to historic losses in output and jobs.
Still, the Canadian economy appears to have avoided the most severe
scenario presented in the Bank’s April _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR).
The level of real GDP in the first quarter was 2.1 percent lower than in
the fourth quarter of 2019. This GDP reading is in the middle of the
Bank’s April monitoring range and reflects the combined impact of
falling oil prices and widespread shutdowns. The level of real GDP in
the second quarter will likely show a further decline of 10-20 percent,
as continued shutdowns and sharply lower investment in the energy sector
take a further toll on output. Decisive and targeted fiscal actions,
combined with lower interest rates, are buffering the impact of the
shutdown on disposable income and helping to lay the foundation for
economic recovery. While the outlook for the second half of 2020 and
beyond remains heavily clouded, the Bank expects the economy to resume
growth in the third quarter.

CPI inflation has decreased to near zero, as anticipated in the April
MPR, mainly due to lower prices for gasoline. The Bank expects temporary
factors to keep CPI inflation below the target band in the near term.
The Bank’s core measures of inflation have drifted down, although by
much less than the CPI, and are now between 1.6 and 2 percent.

The Bank’s programs to improve market function are having their intended
effect. After significant strains in March, short-term funding
conditions have improved. Therefore, the Bank is reducing the frequency
of its term repo operations to once per week, and its program to
purchase bankers’ acceptances to bi-weekly operations. The Bank stands
ready to adjust these programs if market conditions warrant. Meanwhile,
its other programs to purchase federal, provincial, and corporate debt
are continuing at their present frequency and scope.

As market function improves and containment restrictions ease, the
Bank’s focus will shift to supporting the resumption of growth in output
and employment. The Bank maintains its commitment to continue large-
scale asset purchases until the economic recovery is well underway. Any
further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions would be ca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted to provide the necessary
degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) accommodation required to achieve the
inflation target.
