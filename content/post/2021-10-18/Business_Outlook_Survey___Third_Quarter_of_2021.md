## The recovery in demand is progressing but remains uneven

The number of firms with improved indicators of future sales (e.g.,
order books, sales inquiries) remains high—a concrete signal of a broad-
based strengthening in demand relative to a year ago (Chart 6, red
line). The positive outlook is strongest for firms that were hardest hit
by the pandemic: those that provide hard-to-distance services (e.g.,
hospitality, tourism, travel) and the firms that supply inputs to them.
These businesses have benefited from the lifting of some restrictions
over the summer months, high vaccination rates and the release of pent-
up demand. These factors also support their expectations of a faster
pace of sales growth over the next 12 months (Chart 6, blue bars). The
Delta variant is a source of uncertainty, however, and business,
conference and international travel remains well below pre-pandemic
levels. Furthermore, results from this third-quarter BOS and the
[Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations][1] indicate that consumers
are still cautious about engaging in social activities. Because of this,
some of these firms expect a full recovery to take more than a year.

Businesses tied to housing, consumer goods (e.g., food, outdoor
activities) and the government sector (especially infrastructure
spending)—areas that have led the recovery—continue to have a positive
outlook. While most expect sales to continue to increase, firms that
experienced record sales during the pandemic anticipate some
deceleration.
