**OTTAWA, ONTARIO** — The Bank of Canada has announced the five finalist

  * University of Toronto – St. George campus

With special mention to the runner up teams:

  * University of British Columbia

The first round of this year’s competition took place November 15–16,
2021, with presentations delivered by video conference. More than 100
students from 22 Canadian universities participated. The final round
will take place Saturday, February 5, 2022, by video conference.

Working in teams, students provided analysis and forecasts on
developments in the economy. They then presented a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
recommendation to keep inflation low and stable, in line with the Bank’s
inflation target of 2 per cent. The judges evaluated teams on the
substance of their analysis, the quality of their presentation and
evidence of strong teamwork.

The team from the [University of Alberta][2] won last year’s
competition.
