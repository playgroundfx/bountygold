# Strengthening our exports

Speech summary

[Tiff Macklem][126] \- Governor

Greater Vancouver Board of Trade

[Vancouver, British Columbia][127]

December 15, 2020

[ __][128][ __][129][ __][130][ __][131]

Governor Tiff Macklem talks about the importance of trade and exports to
Canada's economic recovery. He also talks about steps [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-makers and
business can take to attract investment and improve competitiveness.

Watch Governor Tiff Macklem speak to the Greater Vancouver Board of
Trade via webcast. [Read the full speech.][132]

## Exports are key to a sustainable recovery

Canada's recovery from the pandemic will be long and choppy, and we need
to expand our exports to help the economy recover fully. Trade has
bounced back since the initial shutdowns at the start of the pandemic,
but obstacles remain. Companies and [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-makers must work together to
create a better path for trade growth.

> Hope is not a strategy. We need to think strategically to increase the
odds of a strong trade recovery."

[ Read about how economies benefit from freer trade in _The Economy,
Plain and Simple_.  ][133]

## More products mean more markets

Canada's traditional strength has been to export raw materials and
manufactured goods to a few key markets, such as the United States. More
recently, we've benefited from exports of services, including education,
digital technology and tourism. For the economy to recover fully, Canada
needs to continue to expand the types of things we export and find more
markets for the goods and services we want to sell.

> We do need to develop new, fast-growing markets for our products, but
we also need to develop new, fast-growing products for our markets."

## Better productivity will boost competitiveness

Canada must improve our productivity to compete and win in global
markets. Businesses can boost productivity by investing in machinery and
equipment, research and development, and employee training. Policy-
makers can help by removing barriers to business investment and by
improving infrastructure and education.

> We won't be able to fully capitalize on our opportunities unless we
take steps to improve our productivity and competitiveness."

Watch Governor Macklem answer questions from the media following his
speech via webcast.

## The Bank of Canada will help

The Bank has lowered interest rates to historic lows to support the
economic recovery. That means borrowing costs have never been lower. The
Bank will continue to support this investment climate by keeping
borrowing costs low until economic slack is gone.
