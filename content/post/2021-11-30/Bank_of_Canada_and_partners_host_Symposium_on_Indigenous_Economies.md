On November 29 and 30, the Bank of Canada, in partnership with the Tulo
Centre of Indigenous Economics and Te Pūtea Matua (Reserve Bank of New
Zealand), hosted the inaugural Symposium on Indigenous Economies.

The goal of the bi-annual conference is to share research, engage in
meaningful discussion, and enhance collaboration among central banks and
Indigenous partners. This year’s event brought together hundreds of
Indigenous and non-Indigenous experts, researchers, and economists to
discuss challenges and opportunities facing Indigenous economies today –
including access to capital, resource development, and Indigenous
businesses and labour markets.

Featuring more than 45 speakers, sessions over the two days focused on
the experiences, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), contributions and barriers facing Indigenous
peoples in Canada and around the world. Participants shared research on
Indigenous [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and economic systems and discussed the contemporary
economic landscape. Policymakers from the Central Bank Network for
Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII) [explored][1] how central banks can
incorporate these learnings into their own organizations and work.

“Our nations have all travelled different paths in our colonial
histories. And each country represented here faces unique realities in
their relationship with Indigenous communities today,” [said Bank of
Canada Governor, Tiff Macklem][2]. “This symposium reflects our shared
desire to work together internationally and within our countries—and
most importantly, with our Indigenous partners—to learn from our
histories and to do better. Together, we’ll define what reconciliation
means for the work of the Bank of Canada—toward a more inclusive and
prosperous economy for everyone.”

“Indigenous nations attending this symposium share a common [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),
colonial tragedy, and hope for the future. We are outsiders to the
economic and fiscal system, but we want in,” said Clarence (Manny)
Jules, Chief Commissioner of the First Nations Tax Commission and
Founder of the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics. “This symposium’s
attendees have the ideas, research and collective will to support the
achievement of these goals and I look forward to our continued work
together to end colonialism once and for all.”

“In our endeavours to promote and foster ongoing dialogue and raise
awareness of Indigenous economic and financial issues, we can all
embrace the concept of Matangirua ki Matangireia. In the Māori language,
this means working in unison, to fulfil our ultimate purpose,” said
Adrian Orr, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

The discussions held throughout the symposium demonstrate a clear desire
for change. Over the coming months, the Bank of Canada and its partners
will continue to build on the strong foundation laid over the past two
days.

The CBNII will continue to seek out new partners throughout 2022. The
next symposium will be held in 2023, hosted by the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand.
