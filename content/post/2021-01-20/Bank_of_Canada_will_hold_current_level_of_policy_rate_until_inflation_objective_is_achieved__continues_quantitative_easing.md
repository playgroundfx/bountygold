The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary
forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing
(QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion
per week.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a severe human and economic toll
in Canada and around the world. The earlier-than anticipated arrival of
effective vaccines will save lives and livelihoods, and has reduced
uncertainty from extreme levels. Nevertheless, uncertainty is still
elevated, and the outlook remains highly conditional on the path of the
virus and the timeline for the effective rollout of vaccines.

The economic recovery has been interrupted in many countries as new
waves of COVID-19 infections force governments to re-impose containment
measures. However, the arrival of effective vaccines combined with
further fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support have boosted the medium-term
outlook for growth. In its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the
Bank projects global growth to average just over 5 percent per year in
2021 and 2022, before slowing to just under 4 percent in 2023. Global
financial markets and commodity prices have reacted positively to
improving economic prospects. A broad-based decline in the US exchange
rate combined with stronger commodity prices have led to a further
appreciation of the Canadian dollar.

Canada’s economy had strong momentum through to late 2020, but the
resurgence of cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures are a
serious setback. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to
be negative. Assuming restrictions are lifted later in the first
quarter, the Bank expects a strong second-quarter rebound. Consumption
is forecast to gain strength as parts of the economy reopen and
confidence improves, and exports and business investment will be buoyed
by rising foreign demand. Beyond the near term, the outlook for Canada
is now stronger and more secure than in the October projection, thanks
to earlier-than-expected availability of vaccines and significant
ongoing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus. After a decline in real GDP of 5 ½ percent in
2020, the Bank projects the economy will grow by 4 percent in 2021,
almost 5 percent in 2022, and around 2 ½ percent in 2023.

CPI inflation has risen to the low end of the Bank’s 1-3 percent target
range in recent months, while measures of core inflation are still below
2 percent. CPI inflation is forecast to rise temporarily to around 2
percent in the first half of the year, as the base-year effects of price
declines at the pandemic’s outset — mostly gasoline — dissipate. Excess
supply is expected to weigh on inflation throughout the projection
period. As it is absorbed, inflation is expected to return sustainably
to the 2 percent target in 2023.

In view of the weakness of near-term growth and the protracted nature of
the recovery, the Canadian economy will continue to require
extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. The Governing Council will hold
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic
slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably
achieved. In our projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To
reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield
curve, the Bank will continue its QE program until the recovery is well
underway.  As the Governing Council gains confidence in the strength of
the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds
will be adjusted as required. We remain committed to providing the
appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery
and achieve the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
March 10, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR on April 21, 2021.

As announced, starting with this decision the target for the overnight
rate will take effect on the business day following each rate
announcement.
