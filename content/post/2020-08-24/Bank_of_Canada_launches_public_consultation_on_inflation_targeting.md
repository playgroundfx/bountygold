The Bank of Canada today launched an online public consultation to
gather Canadians’ views on the Bank’s approach to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The
“[Let’s Talk Inflation][1]” campaign is part of an effort to reach out
to all Canadians before the Bank re[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) its agreement with the federal
government on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework in 2021.

The survey seeks feedback on a range of topics, from their perceptions
of inflation to their views on other approaches that central banks can
use to support price stability and a strong economy. The survey takes
approximately 10 minutes to complete and will run until October 1, 2020.

Civil society, labour and industry organizations are also invited to
send in more detailed submissions for consideration by the Bank’s
Governing Council.

“The Bank is committed to accountability and transparency in everything
we do. The actions we take and how well we do our work affects the lives
of each and every Canadian. Good planning starts with good listening –
and we want to hear from you,” said Bank of Canada Governor Tiff
Macklem. “I hope you take this opportunity to let us know how changes in
the economy are being felt in your life and in your communities. Tell us
what matters to you.”

The Bank has targeted inflation for nearly three decades and currently
adjusts its key interest rate up or down in order to achieve an annual
inflation rate of 2 percent. This approach has succeeded in keeping
inflation low and stable, giving Canadians confidence when making
important financial decisions. Every five years, the Bank and the
federal government renew their agreement on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
framework. Ahead of each renewal, the Bank looks at how it might improve
its approach.

In advance of the 2021 agreement, the Bank is conducting a side-by-side
comparison of different frameworks, ensuring it has the right tools at
its disposal, and assessing how monetary, fiscal and financial stability
policies work together.

The input from the public, along with focus group research and
consultations held with diverse groups representing consumers, labour,
businesses, Indigenous communities, civil society and academia, will
inform the Bank’s thinking on the best monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework for
2022 and beyond. The Bank will publish a report summarizing what it has
heard in the coming months.
