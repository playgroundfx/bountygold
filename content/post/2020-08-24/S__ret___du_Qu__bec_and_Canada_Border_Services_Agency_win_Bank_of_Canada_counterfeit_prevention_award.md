The Bank of Canada is pleased to announce the recipients of its 2020 Law
Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence.

This year’s winners were part of a joint investigation between the
Sûreté du Québec (SQ) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

Lyne Landry and Superintendent Renée Fontaine of the CBSA and Acting
Lieutenant Serge Lachance (since retired) and Detective Sergeant Martin
Parent of SQ led the joint effort to neutralize a large-scale
counterfeiting operation in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, in 2019.

The award recognizes their joint investigation leading to the seizure of
sophisticated counterfeiting equipment. This equipment could have caused
significant financial loss in the Canadian economy through the
production of counterfeit bank notes.

The winners were honoured at the annual Canadian Association of Chiefs
of Police conference, held virtually on August 24, 2020.

This award, which the Bank has presented since 2004, recognizes the
outstanding achievements of criminal justice professionals and educators
involved in the prevention and deterrence of bank note counterfeiting in
Canada.
