##  Getting people back to work

The best way to improve people’s economic well-being over time is to get
them working again and keep them working. Broad-based strength in the
job market can help reduce income inequality.

Government income replacement and wage-support programs have led the
response to this crisis, trying to keep workers connected to their jobs
and supporting those who have been laid off.

For our part, by maintaining low interest rates, the Bank is supporting
consumer spending and business investment by making borrowing more
affordable. This helps the economy grow, which creates jobs. When the
economy gets back to its full capacity with full employment, it helps us
achieve our inflation target.

Given the depth of the economic hole, it’s clear much of this support
will be needed for some time.
