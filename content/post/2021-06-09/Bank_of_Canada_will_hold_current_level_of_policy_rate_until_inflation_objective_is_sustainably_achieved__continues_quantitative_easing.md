The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary
forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced
and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which
continues at a target pace of $3 billion per week.

With COVID-19 cases falling in many countries and vaccine coverage
rising, global economic activity is picking up. Growth remains uneven
across regions, however. The US is experiencing a strong consumer-driven
recovery and a rebound is beginning to take shape in Europe, while a
resurgence of the virus is hampering the recovery in some emerging
market economies. Financial conditions remain highly accommodative,
reflected in broadly higher asset prices. Commodity prices have risen
further, notably oil, and the Canadian dollar has seen a further
appreciation.

In Canada, economic developments have been broadly in line with the
outlook in the April _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR). Despite the second
wave of the virus, first quarter GDP growth came in at a robust 5.6 per
cent. While this was lower than the Bank had projected, the underlying
details indicate rising confidence and resilient demand. Household
spending was stronger than expected, while businesses drew down
inventories and increased imports more than anticipated. Renewed
lockdowns associated with the third wave are dampening economic activity
in the second quarter, largely as anticipated. Recent jobs data show
that workers in [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)-sensitive sectors have once again been most
affected. The employment rate remains well below its pre-pandemic level,
with low wage workers, youth and women continuing to bear the brunt of
job losses.

With vaccinations proceeding at a faster pace, and provincial
containment restrictions on an easing path over the summer, the Canadian
economy is expected to rebound strongly, led by consumer spending.
Housing market activity is expected to moderate but remain elevated.
Strong growth in foreign demand and higher commodity prices should also
lead to a solid recovery in exports and business investment. Despite
progress on vaccinations, there continues to be uncertainty about the
evolution of new COVID-19 variants. More broadly, the risks to the
inflation outlook identified in the April MPR remain relevant.

As expected, CPI inflation has risen to around the top of the 1-3
percent inflation-control range, due largely to base-year effects and
much stronger gasoline prices. Core measures of inflation have also
risen, due primarily to temporary factors and base year effects, but by
much less than CPI inflation. While CPI inflation will likely remain
near 3 percent through the summer, it is expected to ease later in the
year, as base-year effects diminish and excess capacity continues to
exert downward pressure.

The Governing Council judges that there remains considerable excess
capacity in the Canadian economy, and that the recovery continues to
require extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain committed to
holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until
economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is
sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s April projection, this happens
sometime in the second half of 2022. The Bank is continuing its QE
program to reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across
the yield curve. Decisions regarding adjustments to the pace of net bond
purchases will be guided by Governing Council’s ongoing assessment of
the strength and durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide
the appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the
recovery and achieve the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is July
14, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and
inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the
MPR at the same time.
