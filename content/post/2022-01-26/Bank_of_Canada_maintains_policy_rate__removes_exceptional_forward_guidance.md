The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ %, with the Bank Rate at ½ % and the deposit
rate at ¼ %. With overall economic slack now absorbed, the Bank has
removed its exceptional forward guidance on its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate.
The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall
holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.

The global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is strong but uneven. The
US economy is growing robustly while growth in some other regions
appears more moderate, especially in China due to current weakness in
its property sector. Strong global demand for goods combined with supply
bottlenecks that hinder production and transportation are pushing up
inflation in most regions. As well, oil prices have rebounded to well
above pre-pandemic levels following a decline at the onset of the
Omicron variant of COVID-19. Financial conditions remain broadly
accommodative but have tightened with growing expectations that monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will normalize sooner than was anticipated, and with rising
geopolitical tensions. Overall, the Bank projects global GDP growth to
moderate from 6¾ % in 2021 to about 3½ % in 2022 and 2023.

In Canada, GDP growth in the second half of 2021 now looks to have been
even stronger than expected. The economy entered 2022 with considerable
momentum, and a broad set of measures are now indicating that economic
slack is absorbed. With strong employment growth, the labour market has
tightened significantly. Job vacancies are elevated, hiring intentions
are strong, and wage gains are picking up. Elevated housing market
activity continues to put upward pressure on house prices.

The Omicron variant is weighing on activity in the first quarter. While
its economic impact will depend on how quickly this wave passes, it is
expected to be less severe than previous waves. Economic growth is then
expected to bounce back and remain robust over the projection horizon,
led by consumer spending on services, and supported by strength in
exports and business investment. After GDP growth of 4½ % in 2021, the
Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 4% in 2022 and about 3½ % in
2023.

CPI inflation remains well above the target range and core measures of
inflation have edged up since October. Persistent supply constraints are
feeding through to a broader range of goods prices and, combined with
higher food and energy prices, are expected to keep CPI inflation close
to 5% in the first half of 2022. As supply shortages diminish, inflation
is expected to decline reasonably quickly to about 3% by the end of this
year and then gradually ease towards the target over the projection
period. Near-term inflation expectations have moved up, but longer-run
expectations remain anchored on the 2% target. The Bank will use its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools to ensure that higher near-term inflation
expectations do not become embedded in ongoing inflation.

While COVID-19 continues to affect economic activity unevenly across
sectors, the Governing Council judges that overall slack in the economy
is absorbed, thus satisfying the condition outlined in the Bank’s
forward guidance on its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate. The Governing Council
therefore decided to end its extraordinary commitment to hold its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
rate at the effective lower bound. Looking ahead, the Governing Council
expects interest rates will need to increase, with the timing and pace
of those increases guided by the Bank’s commitment to achieving the 2%
inflation target.

The Bank will keep its holdings of Government of Canada bonds on its
balance sheet roughly constant at least until it begins to raise the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate. At that time, the Governing Council will consider
exiting the reinvestment phase and reducing the size of its balance
sheet by allowing roll-off of maturing Government of Canada bonds.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
March 2, 2022. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the
_Monetary Policy Report_ on April 13, 2022.
