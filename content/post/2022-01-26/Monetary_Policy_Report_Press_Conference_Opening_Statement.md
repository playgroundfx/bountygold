Good morning. I’m pleased to be here with you to discuss today’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
announcement and the Bank of Canada’s _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR). I
am especially pleased to have Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers here
for her first press conference. She has joined the Governing Council at
an important time.

Our message today is threefold.

First, the emergency monetary measures needed to support the economy
through the pandemic are no longer required and they have ended.

Second, interest rates will need to increase to control inflation.
Canadians should expect a rising path for interest rates.

Third, while reopening our economy after repeated waves of the COVID-19
pandemic is complicated, Canadians can be confident that the Bank of
Canada will control inflation. We are committed to bringing inflation
back to target.

Let me take each of these in turn.

The Bank’s response to the pandemic has been forceful. Throughout, our
actions have been guided by our mandate. We have been resolute and
deliberate, communicating clearly with Canadians on our extraordinary
measures to support the economy and on the conditions for their exit.
When we introduced emergency liquidity measures to support core funding
markets, we said they would end when market functioning was restored.
And they did. When we launched quantitative easing (QE), we said it
would continue until the recovery was well underway. As the recovery
progressed, we began tapering QE and ended it in October. Today marks
the final step in exiting from emergency policies. We said exceptional
forward guidance would continue until economic slack was absorbed. With
the strength of the recovery through the second half of 2021, the
Governing Council now judges this condition has been met. As such, we
are removing our commitment to hold our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at its floor of
0.25%.

Second, we want to clearly signal that we expect interest rates will
need to increase. A lot of factors are contributing to the uncomfortably
high inflation we are experiencing today, and many of them are global
and reflect the unique circumstances of the pandemic. As the pandemic
fades, conditions will normalize, and inflation will come down. However,
with Canadian labour markets tightening and evidence of capacity
pressures increasing, the Governing Council expects higher interest
rates will be needed to bring inflation back to the 2% target.

Finally, Canadians can be assured that the Bank of Canada will control
inflation. Prices for many goods and services are rising quickly, and
this is making it harder for Canadians to make ends meet—particularly
those with low incomes. Prices for food, gasoline and housing have all
risen faster than usual. We expect inflation will remain close to 5%
through the first half of 2022 and then move lower. There is some
uncertainty about how quickly inflation will come down because we’ve
never experienced a pandemic like this before. But Canadians can be
assured that we will use our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools to control inflation.

Let me turn to the economic outlook that we’ve outlined in our MPR.

Globally, the pandemic recovery is strong but uneven and continues to be
marked by supply chain disruptions. Robust demand for goods combined
with these supply problems and higher energy prices have pushed up
global inflation. With this rise in inflation, expectations that
monetary stimulus will be reduced have been pulled forward and financial
conditions have tightened from very accommodative levels.

In Canada, growth in the second half of 2021 was even stronger than we
had projected, and a wide range of measures now suggest economic slack
is absorbed. With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, first-quarter
growth is likely to be modest, but we expect the impact on our economy
to be less severe than previous waves. We forecast annual growth in
economic activity will be 4% this year and about 3½% in 2023 as consumer
spending on services rebounds and business investment and exports show
solid growth.

CPI inflation is currently well above our target range and core measures
have edged up. Global supply chain disruptions, weather-related
increases in agricultural prices and high energy prices have put upward
pressure on inflation in Canada, and that is expected to continue in the
months ahead. These pressures should ease in the second half of 2022,
and inflation should decline relatively quickly to around 3% by year
end. Further out, we expect demand will moderate and supply will
increase as productivity improves. This will ease price pressures and
bring inflation gradually back close to the 2% target over 2023 and
2024.

Let me now say a few words about the Governing Council’s deliberations.

Of course, we discussed the impact of Omicron. Renewed restrictions and
household caution about this highly infectious variant have temporarily
slowed economic activity. Once again, high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) services sectors have
been hardest hit. But with many more Canadians getting infected in this
wave, worker absences have been more widespread. Our high rates of
vaccination and adaptability to restrictions should limit the downside
economic risks of this wave.

The Governing Council also spent considerable time assessing the overall
balance of demand and supply in the economy. In October, we projected
the output gap would close sometime in the middle quarters of this year.
While measuring the output gap is always uncertain and pandemic-related
distortions make assessing supply more complicated, a broad range of
indicators clearly suggest economic slack has been absorbed more quickly
than expected. Employment is above pre-pandemic levels, businesses are
having a hard time filling job openings, and wage increases are picking
up. Unevenness across sectors remains, but taking all the evidence
together, the Governing Council judges the economy is now operating
close to its capacity.

We debated the most likely path for inflation. The resolution of global
supply bottlenecks has important implications for inflation in Canada.
There is some evidence that supply disruptions may have peaked, but the
spread of Omicron is a new wildcard that could further disrupt global
supply chains. We also considered the potential for some reversal of the
large price increases for goods. This would pull inflation down more
quickly than we forecast. Overall, we judged the risks around our
inflation projection are reasonably balanced.

We also assessed more domestic sources of inflationary pressures. While
global goods price inflation is expected to ease, the tightness in
Canadian labour markets, rising house prices and evident capacity
pressures suggest that if demand continues to grow faster than supply
this will put upward pressure on inflation.

We noted that measures of inflation expectations are broadly in line
with our own forecast, with longer-term expectations remaining well
anchored on the 2% target. We agreed it is paramount to ensure that
higher near-term inflation expectations don’t migrate into higher long-
term expectations and become embedded in ongoing inflation.

Putting all this together, we concluded that, consistent with our
forecast, a rising path for interest rates will be required to moderate
spending growth and bring inflation back to target.

Of course, we discussed when to begin increasing our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest
rate. Our approach to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) throughout the pandemic has been
deliberate, and we were mindful that the rapid spread of Omicron will
dampen spending in the first quarter. So we decided to keep our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
rate unchanged today, remove our commitment to hold it at its floor, and
signal that rates can be expected to increase going forward. As we
indicated in our press release this morning, the timing and pace of
those increases will be guided by the Bank’s commitment to achieving the
2% inflation target.

We take our communication with Canadians very seriously. For almost two
years now we have told Canadians we would keep our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate pinned at
its floor until economic slack is absorbed. With slack absorbed more
quickly than expected, it is time to remove our extraordinary forward
guidance. This ends our emergency [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) setting and signals that
interest rates will now be on a rising path. This is a significant shift
in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and we judged that it is appropriate to move forward
in a deliberate series of steps.

Let me say a final word about another important monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool—our
balance sheet. The Bank will keep the holdings of Government of Canada
bonds on our balance sheet roughly constant at least until we begin to
raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate. At that time, we will consider exiting
the reinvestment phase and reducing the size of our balance sheet by
allowing maturing Government of Canada bonds to roll off. As we have
done in the past, before implementing changes to our balance sheet
management, we will provide more information on our plans.

With that, Senior Deputy Governor Rogers and I will be happy to take
your questions.
