The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly
½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank is also continuing
its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases
of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds.

Both the global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with
the scenario in the July _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR), with activity
bouncing back as countries lift containment measures. The Bank continues
to expect this strong reopening phase to be followed by a protracted and
uneven recuperation phase, which will be heavily reliant on [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support. The pace of the recovery remains highly dependent on the path
of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of social distancing measures
required to contain its spread.

The rebound in the United States has been stronger than expected, while
economic performance among emerging markets has been more mixed. Global
financial conditions have remained accommodative. Although prices for
some commodities have firmed, oil prices remain weak.

In Canada, real GDP fell by 11.5 percent (39 percent annualized) in the
second quarter, resulting in a decline of just over 13 percent in the
first half of the year, largely in line with the Bank’s July MPR central
scenario. All components of aggregate demand weakened, as expected.

As the economy reopens, the bounce-back in activity in the third quarter
looks to be faster than anticipated in July. Economic activity has been
supported by government programs to replace incomes and subsidize wages.
Core funding markets are functioning well, and this has led to a decline
in the use of the Bank’s short-term liquidity programs. Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
is working to support household spending and business investment by
making borrowing more affordable.

Household spending rebounded sharply over the summer, with stronger-
than-expected goods consumption and housing activity largely reflecting
pent-up demand. There has also been a large but uneven rebound in
employment. Exports are recovering in response to strengthening foreign
demand, but are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Business
confidence and investment remain subdued. While recent data during the
reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the
recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with
ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges.

CPI inflation is close to zero, with downward pressure from energy
prices and travel services, and is expected to remain well below target
in the near term. Measures of core inflation are between 1.3 percent and
1.9 percent, reflecting the large degree of economic slack, with the
core measure most influenced by services prices showing the weakest
growth.

As the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to
require extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. The Governing Council
will hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until
economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is
sustainably achieved. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest
rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale
asset purchase program at the current pace. This QE program will
continue until the recovery is well underway and will be ca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted to
provide the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus needed to support the recovery and
achieve the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
October 28, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR at the same time.
