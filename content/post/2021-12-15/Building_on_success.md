##  Our renewed agreement

In the end, the Government and the Bank agreed that the best
contribution monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can make to the well-being of Canadians is
to continue to focus on price stability.

Under the 2022–26 agreement, the cornerstone of our framework remains
the 2 percent inflation target inside a control range of 1 to 3 percent.
The agreement notes that we will continue to use the flexibility of the
framework to actively seek maximum sustainable employment—that is, the
highest level of employment we can achieve without triggering a rise in
inflation.

The primary objective of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is to maintain low and stable
inflation over time. We will be clear about how we will continue to use
the flexibility of the framework and our extended monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools,
when circumstances warrant, to respond to changes in our domestic and
global economy.
