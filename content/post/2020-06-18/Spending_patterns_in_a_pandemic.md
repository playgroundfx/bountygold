##  The second phase: a slow and gradual recuperation

After the initial phase, the speed, strength and breadth of recovery are
harder to predict. The economy will be affected by what happens with the
virus, jobs and incomes, and confidence.

Job growth will be uneven. The hardest-hit sectors—such as restaurants
and retail—typically have high turnover, which may make it easier to
rehire workers. Still, the recovery may be slower in energy-producing
regions that were already struggling.

Women make up the majority of workers in services, so the closures have
affected them in particular. Their return to work may also be more
difficult because of a lack of childcare.

Some areas, such as travel, in-restaurant dining, and cultural and
sporting events, will face a much slower recovery. Since new Canadians
contributed to stronger housing markets before the pandemic, less
immigration may cause a slower recovery for housing.
