## Consumers expect a temporary rise in inflation

**Short-term inflation expectations have responded to the recent rise in
inflation, but consumers expect this increase to be temporary.**
Expectations for inflation one year from now have increased, but medium-
term expectations have not reacted to the recent increase in inflation,
and long-term expectations have fallen (Chart 3)., ,  Most respondents
anticipate that inflation will stay within or just above the Bank’s
inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 percent, consistent with
medium-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored.

The uptick in consumers’ short-term expectations aligns with higher
expectations in the quarter for food, gas and rent inflation. These are
items that respondents purchase frequently.

**Uncertainty around inflation forecasts decreased slightly in the
quarter** and is below the elevated levels seen at the beginning of the
pandemic (Chart 4).
