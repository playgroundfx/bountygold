## An excess supply of labour remains

At the time of the survey substantial excess capacity remained among
businesses hit hard by the pandemic, even while reports of capacity
pressures reached their highest level on record (Chart 3). Many firms
said that labour-related constraints would cause some or significant
difficulties in meeting an unexpected increase in future demand. But the
number of firms stating they have actual labour shortages limiting their
ability to meet current demand remains modest (Chart 4, blue bars).
Indeed, several businesses, often those tied to high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) services,
continue to report an excess supply of labour.

Businesses reporting labour-related constraints linked them to:

  * difficulties finding skilled or specialized labour (e.g., skilled trades, information technology or sales professionals), a situation they expect to persist
  * the pandemic, including constraints caused by travel restrictions and government support programs for workers

Although the share of firms with labour shortages remains low, many
businesses reported that the intensity of labour shortages has increased
from extremely low levels 12 months ago (Chart 4, red line). These
results on labour shortages and labour shortage intensity suggest that
slack remains in labour markets but is being absorbed.

Firms reporting other capacity pressures mentioned supply chain
frictions as a key bottleneck to production. Supply issues were cited
across a wide range of raw materials and finished goods. These frictions
are often tied to constraints on shipping capacity and are more common
than before the pandemic. Most firms expect these constraints to persist
until at least the end of 2021.
