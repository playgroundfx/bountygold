The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
¼ percent, which the Bank considers its effective lower bound. The Bank
Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The
Bank also announced new measures to provide additional support to
Canada’s financial system.

The necessary efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a
sudden and deep contraction in economic activity and employment
worldwide. In financial markets, this has driven a flight to safety and
a sharp repricing of a wide range of assets. It has also pushed down
prices for commodities, especially oil. In this environment, the
Canadian dollar has depreciated since January, although by less than
many other currencies. The sudden halt in global activity will be
followed by regional recoveries at different times, depending on the
duration and severity of the outbreak in each region. This means that
the global economic recovery, when it comes, could be protracted and
uneven.

The Canadian economy was in a solid position ahead of the COVID-19
outbreak, but has since been hit by widespread shutdowns and lower oil
prices. One early measure of the extent of the damage was an
unprecedented drop in employment in March, with more than one million
jobs lost across Canada. Many more workers reported shorter hours, and
by early April some six million Canadians had applied for the Canada
Emergency Response Benefit.

The outlook is too uncertain at this point to provide a complete
forecast. However, Bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the
level of real activity was down 1-3 percent in the first quarter of
2020, and will be 15-30 percent lower in the second quarter than in
fourth-quarter 2019. CPI inflation is expected to be close to 0 percent
in the second quarter of 2020. This is primarily due to the transitory
effects of lower gasoline prices.

The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action to
support individuals and businesses and to lay the foundation for
economic recovery once containment measures start to ease. Fiscal
programs, designed to expand according to the magnitude of the shock,
will help individuals and businesses weather this shutdown phase of the
pandemic, and support incomes and confidence leading into the recovery.
These programs have been complemented by actions taken by other federal
agencies and provincial governments.

For its part, the Bank of Canada has taken measures to improve market
function so that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions have their intended effect on
the economy. This helps ensure that households and businesses continue
to have access to the credit they need to bridge this difficult time,
and that lower interest rates find their way to ultimate borrowers. The
Bank has lowered its target for the overnight rate 150 basis points over
the last three weeks, to its effective lower bound. It has also
conducted lending operations to financial institutions and asset
purchases in core funding markets amounting to around $200 billion.

These actions have served to ease market dysfunction and help keep
credit channels open, although they remain strained. The next challenge
for markets will be managing increased demand for near-term financing by
federal and provincial governments, and businesses and households. The
situation calls for special actions by the central bank. To this end,
the Bank is furthering its efforts with several important steps.

Under its previously-announced program, the Bank will continue to
purchase at least $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week
in the secondary market, and will increase the level of purchases as
required to maintain proper functioning of the government bond market.
Also, the Bank is temporarily increasing the amount of Treasury Bills it
acquires at auctions to up to 40 percent, effective immediately.

The Bank is also announcing today the development of a new Provincial
Bond Purchase Program of up to $50 billion, to supplement its Provincial
Money Market Purchase Program. Further, the Bank is announcing a new
Corporate Bond Purchase Program, in which the Bank will acquire up to a
total of $10 billion in investment grade corporate bonds in the
secondary market. Both of these programs will be put in place in the
coming weeks. Finally, the Bank is further enhancing its term repo
facility to permit funding for up to 24 months.

These measures will work in combination to ease pressure on Canadian
borrowers. As containment restrictions are eased and economic activity
resumes, fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions will help underpin
confidence and stimulate spending by consumers and businesses to restore
growth. The Bank’s Governing Council stands ready to adjust the scale or
duration of its programs if necessary. All the Bank’s actions are aimed
at helping to bridge the current period of containment and create the
conditions for a sustainable recovery and achievement of the inflation
target over time.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June
3, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and
inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the
MPR on July 15, 2020.
