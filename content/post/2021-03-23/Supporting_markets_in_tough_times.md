## With great power comes great responsibility

When we act as lender of last resort, we must guard against moral
hazard—unnecessary risk-taking by those who believe they will be
protected from the consequences.

When we help financial markets and institutions in times of crisis, we
must do it in a way that doesn’t encourage market participants to engage
in excessively risky behaviour once things return to normal. So it’s
important to dial back the programs and tools that we use to support the
economy once they’re no longer needed.

That’s why we started adjusting our programs last autumn as conditions
improved.

Some of the shorter-term debt we purchased has already matured and no
longer appears on our balance sheet. As a result, we expect our balance
sheet to decline to about $475 billion by the end of April. And over the
spring, we will suspend or discontinue a number of the programs that we
put in place to support markets during the crisis.
