In early March, the Bank conducted an online survey of Canadian firms to
supplement the findings of the BOS and better understand the impact of
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly half of the businesses surveyed
anticipate that they will be affected by the conflict.

The most common expected impact is upward cost pressure (Chart 1), tied
mainly to:

  * increased prices for energy and other commodities
  * further supply chain disruptions

Among the firms expecting the conflict to increase their input costs due
to supply chain disruptions, many depend on goods coming from Europe or
Asia. They anticipate rising transportation costs and longer delivery
times, beyond those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other businesses
expect delays and reduced availability of commodities. Many firms plan
to pass conflict-related cost increases on to their customers.

While the invasion of Ukraine is clearly expected to increase firms’
input costs, the anticipated impact on their sales and investment plans
is more ambiguous. Several businesses, predominantly those tied to
energy and other commodities, expect higher sales. Other firms
anticipate their sales will be lower because of supply chain disruptions
and increased uncertainty. Some businesses noted that lingering
uncertainty related to the pandemic, particularly around supply chain
disruptions and associated costs, has been intensified by the conflict.
