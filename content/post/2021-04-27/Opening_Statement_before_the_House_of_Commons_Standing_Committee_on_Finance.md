Good afternoon, Chair and committee members. I’m pleased to be back
before you to discuss the Bank of Canada’s latest _Monetary Policy
Report_ (MPR), the outlook for the Canadian economy and our actions to
support the recovery.

If I had to sum up my messages for you in three words, they would be
_progress, time_ and _commitment_.

First, the economy is making good _progress_. Canadian households and
businesses have shown impressive resilience to the pandemic. The economy
is doing better than we expected. And with more and more Canadians
getting vaccinated, we anticipate better times ahead. Reflecting these
developments, last week we revised up our outlook for the Canadian
economy.

But second, a complete recovery will still take some _time_. The third
wave of the virus is a new setback. It is straining health care systems
in many regions and again hitting sectors where physical distancing is
difficult. Important parts of the economy remain very weak, and too many
Canadians are still unemployed.

Third, the Bank remains steadfast in our _commitment_ to support
Canadian households and businesses through the full length of the
recovery. For working Canadians, a complete recovery means a healthy job
market with good opportunities. And that includes low-wage workers,
women and young people who have been hit hard by this pandemic. A
complete recovery means companies have confidence that the pandemic is
over and are investing to seize new business opportunities. And for both
households and businesses, a complete recovery means they can count on
inflation being sustainably at our 2 percent target.

Let me briefly expand on these themes.

At the time of our last MPR in January, Canada was facing a second wave
of the pandemic and we expected the economy to contract modestly in the
first quarter of 2021.

As it turns out, it now looks like the economy grew strongly in the
first quarter. This is partly because the global economy is stronger,
particularly in the United States. But the most important factor is the
resilience and adaptability of Canadian households and businesses. They
have found new ways to shop, serve customers and work remotely. As a
result, lockdowns through the second wave had much less economic impact
than they did through the first wave. And as restrictions were eased,
the economy bounced back with substantial job gains in February and
March.

Housing construction and resales have been particularly strong, rising
to historic highs. This is being driven by the desire for more living
space, low mortgage rates and limited supply. But we are seeing signs of
extrapolative expectations in some housing markets, and there are risks
that some households may overstretch financially. We will continue to
watch this area closely.

With vaccinations progressing, we are expecting strong consumption-led
growth in the second half of this year. Fiscal stimulus from the federal
and provincial governments will also make an important contribution to
growth. Strong foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected
to drive a solid rebound in exports and business investment, leading to
a more broad-based recovery. We now project that the economy will grow
by around 6½ percent this year, about 3¾ percent in 2022 and 3¼ percent
in 2023.

With this improved outlook, we are hopeful that there will be less
labour market scarring and lost capacity than we earlier feared, and we
have revised up our estimate of the economy’s potential output.

But I want to emphasize that considerable uncertainty surrounds our
estimate of potential output. As the recovery continues, we will be
paying attention to a broad spectrum of indicators of slack, including a
range of labour market measures.

Last week, we saw that inflation rose slightly above our 2 percent
target in March. This increase was expected. Indeed, over the next
couple of months, we anticipate inflation will rise further to around
the top of our 1 to 3 percent inflation-control target range. This
largely reflects base-year effects combined with the recent rise in
gasoline prices. Governing Council is looking through these temporary
increases in inflation because we expect the ongoing excess supply in
the economy to pull inflation back down. Inflation should return to 2
percent on a sustained basis as slack is absorbed in the second half of
2022.

Taking into account the improved economic outlook and the considerable
slack that remains, Governing Council judged last week that the economy
still needs extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain committed
to holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until
economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is
sustainably achieved. As I just mentioned, based on our latest
projection, this is expected to happen sometime in the second half of
2022, although this timing is unusually uncertain given the difficulties
in assessing the economy’s supply capacity.

Our forward guidance on our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate continues to be reinforced and
supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program. Effective
this week, we have adjusted our weekly purchases of Government of Canada
bonds to a target of $3 billion, down from the previous minimum of $4
billion. This adjustment reflects the progress that we have already seen
toward economic recovery.

Before I turn to your questions, let me just say a few words about our
QE program and its impact on our balance sheet, as I know this is a
topic of interest for many committee members.

Around this time last year, the Bank launched a number of extraordinary
programs—11 in all—to help restore functioning in financial markets and
keep credit flowing. These programs worked, and with markets now
functioning well, we have wound down or announced the termination of all
but one of our extraordinary programs. The one remaining is our QE
program. It is still providing needed monetary stimulus by lowering
borrowing costs for households and businesses across the yield curve.

With the other programs winding down and QE continuing, the size and
composition of our balance sheet has shifted in the past several months.
The size of our balance sheet peaked back in February at about $575
billion. It has since decreased to about $475 billion. This decline
reflects the maturing of some shorter-term assets and the termination of
most of our extraordinary programs.

We continue to buy government bonds to provide stimulus in pursuit of
our inflation objective. The Bank currently holds $354 billion of
Government of Canada bonds, comprising more than 70 percent of the
assets on our balance sheet. This is up from 55 percent at the time of
our January MPR.

I’ve provided a [chart][1] that shows the evolution of our balance
sheet, and a [table][2] that provides more detail on the maturity
composition of our holdings. As you can see from the table, the Bank of
Canada currently owns just over 40 percent of the outstanding stock of
Government of Canada bonds. Across the maturity spectrum of nominal
bonds, our ownership ranges from 48 percent for 5-year bonds to 36
percent for 10-year bonds. We routinely make available high-demand bonds
through our securities-lending program, which helps promote the smooth
functioning of Canada’s bond market.

I’ve given you a lot of numbers. The message I want to leave you with is
that our purchases have provided a lot of stimulus to the economy. With
the progress toward economic recovery that we have already seen, we
adjusted the amount of incremental stimulus we are adding each week with
our purchases.

Looking ahead, further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be
guided by our ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the
economic recovery. If the recovery evolves in line with or stronger than
in our latest projection, the economy won’t need as much QE stimulus
over time. Further adjustments to our QE program will be gradual, and we
will be deliberate in both our assessment of incoming data and the
communication of our analysis.

We remain committed to providing the appropriate degree of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation
objective.

With that, let me stop and turn to you for questions.
