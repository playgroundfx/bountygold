_Joint statement from the Bank of Canada, Te Pūtea Matua (Reserve Bank
of New Zealand) and the Reserve Bank of Australia._

Along with Indigenous partners, the Bank of Canada, Te Pūtea Matua
(Reserve Bank of New Zealand) and the Reserve Bank of Australia have
formed a voluntary network to foster ongoing dialogue and raise
awareness of Indigenous economic and financial issues.

The [Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion][1], established
January 1, 2021, aims to share knowledge and best practices, promote
engagement with Indigenous Peoples, and foster greater understanding and
education about Indigenous economic issues and histories.

The network will focus on:

  * Conducting research for and with Indigenous peoples on economic issues, including the development of best practices, such as using Indigenous data respectfully.
  * Building cultural awareness, recruitment practices and other aspects of corporate culture to foster Indigenous inclusion within member organizations.
  * Strengthening engagement practices with Indigenous groups and communities.
  * Supporting economic and financial education for and about Indigenous peoples.

In addition, the network will plan a recurring Central Bank Symposium on
Indigenous Economics. The first symposium will be hosted by the Bank of
Canada in late 2021.

In formative discussions, Indigenous partners drew on their oral
histories and contemporary economic experience to guide discussion and
confirmation of the network’s aims. This discussion sought the views of
Indigenous partners including Te Rau Kupenga, representative of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Te Ao Māori external [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y panel; and
Manny Jules, Chief Commissioner, First Nations Tax Commission and
Founder of the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics.

The Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion will serve as a
community of practice and will not aim to set or take [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) positions.
The founding members encourage other central banking entities around the
world to join. The chair of the Network will rotate annually, with the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand serving as chair in 2021.

**Bank of Canada:** "The Bank of Canada wants to better understand the
Indigenous economy and the obstacles and opportunities that Canada's
Indigenous Peoples face," Governor Tiff Macklem said. “Our membership in
this network provides us with an invaluable opportunity to learn from
each other, to forge stronger bonds with Indigenous communities and
contribute to making our workplaces and policies more inclusive.”

**Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics** **:** “As Indigenous peoples, we
have institutional and economic successes to share, as well as [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
and legislative challenges we continue to face. But today, I see the
potential for a better tomorrow. Your commitment to work with each other
and with us on these issues gives me hope.”

Clarence (Manny) Jules, Chief Commissioner of the First Nations Tax
Commission and Founder of the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics
