Even before the Omicron variant began to spread in Canada, the shift
back to pre-pandemic spending patterns may have been slowing. The share
of consumers expecting to spend more on in-person services, such as
dining in restaurants and travelling, remained positive but softened in
the fourth quarter of 2021 (Chart 10). This may reflect a return to
normal spending on in-person services after a period of elevated
spending that began when some pandemic containment measures were lifted
in the summer. As well, in follow-up interviews, respondents said they
are limiting their plans to travel, especially abroad. They cited a lack
of clarity about COVID‑19 restrictions and concerns about frequent
changes.

At the same time, the share of respondents expecting to spend more on
goods (such as groceries, furniture, appliances, cars) increased
significantly. Some said that as restaurant prices have increased, they
have reduced their consumption of restaurant meals and are now spending
these savings on groceries.

Supply chain issues, including shipping delays caused by flooding in
British Columbia, are limiting consumers’ shopping choices. In
interviews, people noted that they often see empty shelves at grocery
stores and generally find less selection than usual for products. They
also reported recently experiencing delivery delays for online
purchases; as a result, they are shopping locally more often.
