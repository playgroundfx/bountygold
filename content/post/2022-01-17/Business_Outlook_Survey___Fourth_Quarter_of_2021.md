## Inflation expectations are elevated

Expectations for total consumer price index inflation have moved up
further, with two-thirds of firms now expecting inflation to be above 3%
over the next two years (Chart 11). As in the previous survey,
businesses noted several factors driving higher inflation, including:

  * supply chain disruptions
  * prices for gasoline, other energy products and food staples
  * the impact of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies

Upward wage pressures on inflation were also cited more frequently,
particularly by firms that anticipate inflation will remain above the
target of 2% over a longer period. That said, in response to a special
question, most firms said they expect currently elevated inflationary
pressures to dissipate over time, with inflation returning close to
target in one to three years.
