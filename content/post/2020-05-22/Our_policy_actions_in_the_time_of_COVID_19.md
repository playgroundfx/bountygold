## Our response

In the days and weeks since the COVID-19 pandemic came to Canada, the
Bank of Canada has been taking action to ensure our economy and
financial system are weathering the unprecedented shock of the shutdown.
We have responded in two main ways. First, we have cut our key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
interest rate to 0.25Â percent. Second, we have been buying bonds and
other debts to help keep key funding markets functioning well.

Together, these actions are designed to set the stage for a solid
recovery when the restrictions of the pandemic are lifted. The shutdown
is temporary, but the restraining of so much activity can have long-
lasting effects if governments, businesses and households do not have
access to funding to tide them over. We are helping to ensure that such
access remains available throughout the crisis.

> This is a time when there is a particular need for credit on the part
of both businesses and households, and the things we are doing are
designed to ensure that that credit remains available. So we are helping
to put money into the hands of Canadians, and that is an important
ingredient for having a strong recovery once the economy is finally
ready to open up again."

>

> [Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada][131]

## Lowering interest rates

Lowering interest rates is the Bank's best-known tool to encourage
borrowing to stimulate the economy. In normal times, our key [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate
filters through the economy by affecting rates on things like mortgages
and savings accounts at banks. But these are not normal times, and our
rate cuts can do little to stimulate the economy because the shutdown
means there is almost nowhere to spend. Instead, cutting rates to near
zero provides support for other parts of the credit market. It helps
lower debt-servicing costs for many borrowers at a time when every
dollar counts. This ensures that when the recovery does start, it will
have the best momentum we can give it.

Some have asked why rates can't be lowered to zero or beyond, into
negative territory--a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that some other central banks have
implemented. Negative rates happen when central banks lower their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
rates below zero and charge interest for holding bank deposits (it's
usually the other way around). We could still use negative rates if we
thought it was necessary. But zero or negative rates come at a cost--
they can impair the function of key funding markets. This is because
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would pull money out of short-term financial assets and hold
other assets, such as cash, that don't charge negative rates. This is
particularly true if the banks pass these negative rates on to their
depositors. That is the opposite of what we want to achieve at a time
when the system is already under tremendous strain.

Deputy Governor Timothy Lane explains how the Bank of Canada has taken
action to help the economy and financial system respond to COVID-19.

## Ensuring access to credit

This brings us to the second part of the Bank's action: the purchase of
bonds and other debt from governments and businesses. Governments have
ramped up spending to support Canadians who have lost jobs and income.
Businesses and households need to borrow to pay their bills. An
important way that governments and corporations borrow is by issuing
debt securities, such as bonds, treasury bills, commercial paper and
bankers' acceptances, which are then traded in financial markets. Banks
also use those markets to fund their lending to businesses and
households.

Normally, there are enough buyers and sellers in debt markets so that
governments and businesses as well as banks can secure funding. But in
times of financial stress, the institutions that trade in those markets
may pull back, preferring to hold cash rather than debt securities. If
that happens, those markets could stop functioning properly, resulting
in a "credit crunch." To prevent that, one of our key roles is to make
sure there is enough liquidity or cash in the system to allow
transactions in debt markets to happen. By buying up bonds and other
debt, we unblocked the lines of financing, smoothed the functioning of
these markets, and freed up cash that companies and governments can use
to pay salaries and suppliers and provide emergency benefits to those in
need.

> Together, our rate cuts and purchasing programs have given borrowers
better access to credit at a time when they need it most. By helping
debt markets work better, we have put more money in the hands of
Canadians and helped ensure that lower interest rates find their way to
ultimate borrowers. In this way, we have set the stage for a strong
recovery when life in Canada returns to normal."
