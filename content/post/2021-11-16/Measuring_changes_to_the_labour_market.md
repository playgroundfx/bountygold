## Understanding slack helps us set monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)

The Bank’s goal is to support strong employment and output growth by
keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. While inflation has risen
above our 1 to 3 percent inflation control range in recent months due to
transitory effects of rising energy prices and global supply
constraints, medium-term inflation expectations have remained relatively
well anchored.

By measuring the health of the labour market, the Bank can tell when:

  * demand for goods and services is not balanced with what the economy supplies 
  * inflation pressures are rising or falling

The economy has made good progress toward recovery, but some excess
capacity, or slack, remains. The better the Bank understands this issue,
the better we are able to respond with [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that supports a full and
inclusive recovery by bringing inflation sustainably back to the 2
percent target.
