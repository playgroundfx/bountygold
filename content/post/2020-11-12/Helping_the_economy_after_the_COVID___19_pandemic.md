##  Boosting productivity is now more important than ever

We need more growth in the economy to raise living standards for
everyone. Economic growth can help create jobs, which will reduce the
damage from scarring in the workforce. An important way to boost the
potential for growth is to increase productivity.

The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that Canadians are showing they can innovate. Think

provide medical equipment. Canada needs to take advantage of these kinds
of innovations to raise productivity.
