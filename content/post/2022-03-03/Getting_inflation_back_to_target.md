## Our strong recovery continues

In Januaryâ€™s _Monetary Policy Report_ , we told Canadians that the
emergency monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) put in place to support the economy through
the pandemic was no longer needed. We ended our exceptional forward
guidance and signalled that a rising path for interest rates was on the
horizon.

Since then, economic conditions have unfolded largely as we expected.
GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 was strong at 6.7%, reinforcing
our view that the economy is once again producing at its full capacity.
Inflation remains too high at around 5%. The invasion of Ukraine is
pushing up prices for both energy and food-related commodities. This is
a major new source of uncertainty.
