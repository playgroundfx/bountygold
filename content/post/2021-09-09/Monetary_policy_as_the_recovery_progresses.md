##  Work will continue after QE ends

Once we no longer need to add new stimulus through QE, we’ll stop
increasing the size of our holdings of Government of Canada bonds.

A lot of monetary stimulus will remain in the system—and the economy
will still need it. So, to keep our bond holdings relatively stable,
we’ll need to buy enough bonds to replace those that are maturing.

Essentially, we will be reinvesting the proceeds of maturities, so we
call this the reinvestment phase.

Eventually, when we need to start reducing the amount of monetary
stimulus, you can expect us to begin by raising our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest
rate. That means it is reasonable to expect that when we reach the
reinvestment phase, we will remain there for a period of time, at least
until we raise the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate.

But, ultimately, when we arrive at the reinvestment phase and how long
we stay there will depend on the strength of the recovery and how
inflation evolves.
