##  Risks to households, businesses and markets remain

As we said in our May 2020 [_Financial System Review_][1], the longer
the pandemic affects jobs and incomes, the greater the risk of financial
trouble for households and businesses. In the early days we also saw
strains on the functioning of financial markets. Six months later, we
have a better idea of the impacts of COVID‑19.

###  Households

Government income support programs and loan deferral initiatives offered
by financial institutions helped households get through the initial
crisis. People were able to keep paying their debts, and we’re seeing
lower levels in household and consumer debt. This is cause for optimism.

Going forward, we will keep a close eye on household debt levels,
especially with interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future.

###  Businesses

The pandemic severely affected many businesses across Canada. Businesses
relying on in-person [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) suffered most, including those in:

  * transportation
  * arts and entertainment 
  * accommodation and food services 

Government wage and rent subsidies have helped keep bankruptcy filings
low, but we’ll need to watch how more localized shutdowns affect the
long recovery.

###  Market functioning

With uncertainty high, it is vital that markets keep functioning well to
support what households and businesses may need down the road.

The Bank put in place asset purchase programs and liquidity facilities
at the start of the pandemic, and these have kept the financial system
running smoothly. We’ve since been able to end some of these programs.
But we can and will start them up again if the need arises.
