The Bank of Canada and Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) today released the [results][1] of a pilot project
on climate scenario analysis. This pilot was an important step in
helping Canada’s financial sector improve its ability to analyze
economic and financial risks affecting financial institutions that could
arise from climate change.

Together with six Canadian financial institutions, the Bank and OSFI
developed [scenarios][2] that will help the financial sector identify,
measure and disclose climate-related risks. These scenarios were not
intended to be forecasts or predictions. Rather, they were specifically
designed to capture a range of potential outcomes and illustrate the
kinds of stresses on the financial system and economy that could occur
as the world transitions to a low-carbon future.

All scenarios showed that this transition will entail important risks
for some economic sectors. Mispricing of transition risks could expose
financial institutions and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sudden and large losses. It
could also delay investments needed to help mitigate the impact of
climate change.

The scenarios highlighted that meeting climate targets will lead to
significant structural changes for the Canadian and global economies,
and that this transition will be more challenging in countries like
Canada that have large carbon-intensive sectors. As well, the analysis
showed that delaying climate [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action increases the overall
economic impacts and risks to financial stability. In the scenario
analysis, the economic impacts for Canada are driven mostly by declines
in global commodity prices.

An important caveat is that the scenarios make very conservative
assumptions about the evolution of green technologies. Therefore, they
do not capture potential disruptive technology impacts or opportunities.
The scenarios also deliberately focus on transition risks rather than
physical risks. The manifestation of physical risks, and efforts to
avoid or mitigate their impact, could also have significant implications
for the global and Canadian economies and the financial system. This is
an area for future work.

Scenario analysis is a better tool to use for this work than traditional
economic models because climate change is global and complex and the
risks involved have very long time horizons. Further, there is a large
amount of uncertainty about how emerging technologies and policies will
evolve to address climate change.

The pilot, which was launched in late 2020, built on work by the Central
Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)—a
group of more than 100 members that defines and promotes best practices
in climate risk management in the financial sector. The Bank of Canada
joined the NGFS in 2019, and OSFI joined last year. While the NGFS
pioneered the use of scenario analysis to examine climate change risks,
the pilot extended that work by looking at potential impacts on specific
economic sectors.

The pilot also provided insight on the maturity of climate related
governance and risk management practices of Canadian financial
institutions, and their level of preparedness for managing risks. More
robust management of climate related financial risks is essential for
institutions to better understand how they are exposed to climate change
under different potential scenario pathways.

Both the public and private sectors are in the early stages of building
their capacity to assess risks related to climate change.

In the future, it will be important to work toward better data
collection on exposures and vulnerabilities and for more institutions to
employ scenario analysis. Future work could consider, for example,
physical risks related to climate change, other types of risk, or larger
systemic considerations.

For its part, the Bank of Canada plans to build its capacity to assess
the implications of more frequent severe weather events and the
transition to a low-carbon economy for potential output growth, the
labour market and inflation, while OSFI announced today in an [industry
letter][3] that it will issue draft guidance on climate risk management
for federally regulated financial institutions later this year.

## Quotes

“Climate change will have broad economic and financial impacts, so the
Bank has committed to develop new models and methods to better
understand physical and transition effects on the Canadian economy. This
pilot illustrates how the public and private sectors need to work
together to ensure our economy and financial system are adequately
prepared to handle the transition to a low-carbon economy.”  
— Toni Gravelle, Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada

“Climate scenario exercises, like this one, make clear the potential
financial impacts of climate-related transition risks across a range of
different climate pathways. This work is a critical step toward building
risk management capability and awareness among regulated entities and
thereby promoting financial resilience through the transition.”  
— Ben Gully, Assistant Superintendent, Office of the Superintendent of
Financial Institutions
