The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50
basis points to ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent
and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. This unscheduled rate decision brings
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate to its effective lower bound and is intended to provide
support to the Canadian financial system and the economy during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The spread of COVID-19 is having serious consequences for Canadians and
for the economy, as is the abrupt decline in world oil prices. The
pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) action
in Canada to support individuals and businesses and to minimize any
permanent damage to the structure of the economy.

The Bank is playing an important complementary role in this effort. Its
interest rate setting cushions the impact of the shocks by easing the
cost of borrowing. Its efforts to maintain the functioning of the
financial system are helping keep credit available to people and
companies. The intent of our decision today is to support the financial
system in its central role of providing credit in the economy, and to
lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy.

The Bank’s efforts have been primarily focused on ensuring the
availability of credit by providing liquidity to help markets continue
to function.  To promote credit availability, the Bank has expanded its
various term repo facilities. To preserve market function, the Bank is
conducting Government of Canada bond buybacks and switches, purchases of
Canada Mortgage Bonds and banker’s acceptances, and purchases of
provincial money market instruments. All these additional measures have
been detailed on the Bank’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) and will be extended or augmented as
needed.

Today, the Bank is launching two new programs.

First, the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP) will help to
alleviate strains in short-term funding markets and thereby preserve a
key source of funding for businesses. Details of the program will be
available on the Bank’s web site.

Second, to address strains in the Government of Canada debt market and
to enhance the effectiveness of all other actions taken so far, the Bank
will begin acquiring Government of Canada securities in the secondary
market. Purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week,
across the yield curve. The program will be adjusted as conditions
warrant, but will continue until the economic recovery is well underway.
The Bank’s balance sheet will expand as a result of these purchases.

The Bank is closely monitoring economic and financial conditions, in
coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities, and
will update its outlook in mid-April. As the situation evolves,
Governing Council stands ready to take further action as required to
support the Canadian economy and financial system and to keep inflation
on target.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
April 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR at the same time.
