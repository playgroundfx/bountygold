Good morning, and thank you for joining Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins
and me to discuss today’s interest rate decision. Before turning to your
questions, let me briefly summarize today’s announcements.

First, we have lowered our target for the overnight rate by 50 basis
points to ¼ percent. This unscheduled rate decision brings the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
rate to its effective lower bound, to provide support to the Canadian
financial system and to the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government has announced decisive fiscal actions to defend Canadians
and the economy from the damaging effects of COVID-19. These actions are
designed to support individuals and businesses through this very
difficult time, and to minimize any permanent damage to the structure of
the economy.

Our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is playing an important supporting role. Low
interest rates help to cushion the shock by easing the cost of
borrowing. We are also working to keep the financial system functioning,
helping make sure credit is available to people and companies. The
intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the
financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer
term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy.

We are conducting a series of market operations to help ensure that
credit is available and that markets continue to function. We’ve
announced two new ones today. First, the Commercial Paper Purchase
Program will help to restore a key source of short-term funding for
businesses. Second, the Bank will begin acquiring Government of Canada
securities in the secondary market. This will help address strains in
the Government of Canada debt market and enhance the effectiveness of
all other actions taken so far. We will keep this program going until
it’s clear the economic recovery is well underway.

The Bank is closely monitoring economic and financial conditions, in
coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities. We will
update our outlook in mid-April. As the situation evolves, Governing
Council stands ready to take further action as required to support the
Canadian economy and its financial system and to keep inflation on
target.

With that, Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I are happy to take your
questions.
