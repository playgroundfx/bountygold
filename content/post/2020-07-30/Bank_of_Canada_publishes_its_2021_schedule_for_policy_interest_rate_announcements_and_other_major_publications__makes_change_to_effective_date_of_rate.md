The Bank of Canada today published its 2021 schedule for [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest
rate announcements and the release of the quarterly _Monetary Policy
Report_. It also reconfirmed the scheduled interest rate announcement
dates for the remainder of this year.  
  
In addition, the Bank published its schedule for the release of the
_Business Outlook Survey_ and the _Canadian Survey of Consumer
Expectations_.  
  
The scheduled dates for the interest rate announcements from September
2020 through December 2020 are reconfirmed as follows:

  * Wednesday, September 9
  * Wednesday, October 28*
  * Wednesday, December 9

The scheduled dates for the interest rate announcements for 2021 are as
follows:

  * Wednesday, January 20*
  * Wednesday, March 10
  * Wednesday, April 21*
  * Wednesday, June 9
  * Wednesday, July 14*
  * Wednesday, September 8
  * Wednesday, October 27*
  * Wednesday, December 8

* _Monetary Policy Report_ published  
  
The _Monetary Policy Report_ will be published concurrently with the
January, April, July and October rate announcements.  
  
Starting in 2021, the target for the overnight rate will take effect on
the business day following each rate announcement. This differs from the
Bankâ€™s current approach, whereby Governing Council rate decisions apply
immediately upon release. The Bank is also reviewing the publication
time of its interest rate announcements, which is currently 10:00 (ET).
Any changes resulting from this review will be communicated in due
course.  
  
The scheduled dates for the release of the 2021 issues of the _Business
Outlook Survey_ and the _Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations_ are
as follows:

  * Monday, January 11
  * Monday, April 12
  * Monday, July 5
  * Monday, October 18

All survey releases will take place at 10:30 (ET).
