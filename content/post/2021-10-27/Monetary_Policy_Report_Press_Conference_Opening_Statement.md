Good morning. I’m pleased to be here with you—in person—to discuss
today’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement and the Bank’s _Monetary Policy Report_
(MPR).

It seems fitting that we are back together in this somewhat normal
setting as we conclude one part of our extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
response to this pandemic. This morning we announced that we are ending
quantitative easing (QE) after more than year and a half.

We undertook QE first to help restore market functioning and then to
boost our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus. Since last October, in line with
progress in Canada’s economic recovery, we have been gradually reducing
the pace of our QE purchases. With the economy once again growing
robustly, Governing Council judged that QE is no longer needed. This
means we will stop growing our holdings of Government of Canada bonds.
It is important, however, to remind Canadians that the significant
stimulus we have injected through QE remains in place. We just won’t be
adding to it. We call this the reinvestment phase. In this phase, we
will purchase bonds only to replace those that are maturing so that our
overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds remain roughly stable
over time.

The end of QE comes as increasing vaccination rates are enabling
continued progress in the economic recovery in Canada and around the
world. While new complications of reopening continue to crop up and that
is boosting the prices of many globally traded goods, I’m struck by how
much progress our economy has made since the start of the crisis. We’ve
come a long way. And our forecast is for an increasingly healthy
economy, even if these complications are going to be with us for a while
longer.

We are forecasting annual growth in economic activity will be around 5
percent this year, and about 4¼ percent in 2022 and 3¾ percent in 2023.
Global supply chain disruptions and shipping bottlenecks are expected to
restrain growth and boost prices into next year. So relative to our
forecast in July, growth in Canada is a little lower and inflation takes
longer to come back down. The main forces pushing up prices—higher
energy prices and supply bottlenecks—now appear stronger and more
persistent than we previously thought.

Let me expand on these themes and say a few words about the key points
of the Governing Council’s deliberations.

Of course, we discussed the evolution of COVID-19. While vaccination
rates are generally very high in Canada and the number of cases in most
regions has declined, the pandemic continues to disrupt our lives. Some
of the disruptions were expected—we’ve never closed and reopened the
economy before, so it was bound to be bumpy. But others, including
labour-market frictions and supply disruptions, are more pronounced than
anticipated. Let me talk about each of these in turn.

We’ve seen strong job growth in recent months. Many sectors that were
hardest hit by lockdowns earlier in the pandemic rebounded strongly as
Canadians resumed more normal activities. Strong job growth has reduced
the very uneven impacts of the pandemic, particularly for youth and
women. However, the recovery of low-wage jobs continues to lag, many
people are not working as many hours as they would like, and the large
number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months
remains a concern.

Slack remains in the labour market. But even as the unemployment rate
remains well above pre-pandemic levels, job vacancies have risen
sharply. This is unusual.

Our recent _Business Outlook Survey_ indicates that labour shortages
have intensified in two areas. The first is shortages of skilled trades
and digital workers. This is a challenge that existed before the
pandemic as well. The second is more pandemic-specific. As service
businesses like restaurants and stores reopened this summer, many had
trouble hiring workers quickly enough to meet the surge in demand. Part
of this reflects the reality that it simply takes time for companies to
find workers with the right skills, and for workers to find the right
jobs. Repeated closures in some sectors and the challenges of working in
high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) jobs during a pandemic may also be affecting the workforce.
About half of the unemployed workers who responded to the recent
Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations said they’re considering a move
to a different industry.

With lots of Canadians still looking for work, and many employers
hiring, we expect employment growth to continue in the months ahead. But
the process of matching workers and jobs is more difficult than in a
typical recovery, and it could take some time to work through these
issues.

Governing Council also spent time discussing supply chain disruptions.
The global shortage of semiconductors and other manufacturing inputs, as
well as shipping and other transportation bottlenecks, are affecting
production and delaying deliveries of many goods. While we highlighted
some of these problems in our July MPR, they are more widespread and
look to be more persistent than we anticipated. Quantifying the impact
of these supply factors is difficult, but the implication is that there
is likely less excess supply in the economy than we thought there would
be. We now expect the output gap to close sometime in the middle
quarters of 2022, which is earlier than we projected in July. Let me
underline there is more uncertainty than normal around the economy’s
productive capacity due to the unusual circumstances of the pandemic.

The combination of on-going supply disruptions and related cost
pressures, as well as higher energy prices, is putting upward pressure
on many prices around the world. In Canada, inflation is currently
running at about 4½ percent. We now expect it will rise to close to 5
percent by the end of this year, before coming back down to around the 2
percent target by the end of next year. In other words, we continue to
expect that inflation will ease back, but relative to our July forecast,
it is higher for longer.

We know higher prices are challenging for Canadians, making it harder
for them to cover their bills. I want to assure you that inflation is
not going to stay as high as it is today, even if it is going to take
somewhat longer to come down. The Bank of Canada is committed to
ensuring that price increases don’t become ongoing inflation. So far,
measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations remain well
anchored on the 2 percent target, and overall wage pressures remain
moderate. This suggests that higher prices are not becoming embedded in
expectations of ongoing inflation. As these forces play out, it is our
job to bring inflation back to target, and I can assure you we will do
that.

In view of the continued excess capacity in the economy, my fellow
Governing Council members and I judged that the economy still needs
considerable monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. While we ended QE, we kept our
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at its lowest level, and reaffirmed our commitment
to keep it there until slack in the economy is absorbed so that the 2
percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on our current
projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022.

Let me conclude with some additional information on the end of QE and
the shift to reinvestment. Following the announcement of our decision
this morning, we issued a market notice outlining in detail the changes
to our market operations. Because bond maturities are lumpy, we are
moving to a monthly rather than a weekly target range for our purchases.
That target range will be $4 billion to $5 billion per month. This
includes our purchases in both the primary and secondary markets. As
outlined in the market notice, to keep our holdings of Government of
Canada bonds roughly stable, we plan to purchase roughly $1 billion to
$2 billion per month in the primary market, and roughly $2½ billion to
3½ billion per month in the secondary market.

How long the reinvestment phase lasts is a future monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
decision. It will depend on the strength of the recovery and the
evolution of inflation. But as I indicated in September, it is
reasonable to expect that we will be there for a period of time, at
least until we raise our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate.

We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.

With that, let me stop and turn to you for questions.
