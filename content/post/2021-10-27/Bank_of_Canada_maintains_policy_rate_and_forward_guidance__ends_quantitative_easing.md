The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank’s extraordinary forward guidance
on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is
ending quantitative easing (QE) and moving into the reinvestment phase,
during which it will purchase Government of Canada bonds solely to
replace maturing bonds.

The global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing.
Vaccines are proving highly effective against the virus, although their
availability and distribution globally remain uneven and COVID variants
pose risks to health and economic activity. In the face of strong global
demand for goods, pandemic-related disruptions to production and
transportation are constraining growth.  Inflation rates have increased
in many countries, boosted by these supply bottlenecks and by higher
energy prices. While bond yields have risen in recent weeks, financial
conditions remain accommodative and continue to support economic
activity.

The Bank projects global GDP will grow by 6½ percent in 2021 – a strong
pace but less than projected in the July _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR)
– and by 4¼ percent in 2022 and about 3½ percent in 2023.

In Canada, robust economic growth has resumed, following a pause in the
second quarter. Strong employment gains in recent months were
concentrated in hard-to-distance sectors and among workers most affected
by lockdowns. This has significantly reduced the very uneven impact of
the pandemic on workers. As the economy reopens, it is taking time for
workers to find the right jobs and for employers to hire people with the
right skills. This is contributing to labour shortages in certain
sectors, even as slack remains in the overall labour market.

The Bank now forecasts Canada’s economy will grow by 5 percent this year
before moderating to 4¼ percent in 2022 and 3¾ percent in 2023. Demand
is expected to be supported by strong consumption and business
investment, and a rebound in exports as the US economy continues to
recover. Housing activity has moderated, but is expected to remain
elevated. On the supply side, shortages of manufacturing inputs,
transportation bottlenecks, and difficulties in matching jobs to workers
are limiting the economy’s productive capacity. Although the impact and
persistence of these supply factors are hard to quantify, the output gap
is likely to be narrower than the Bank had forecast in July.

The recent increase in CPI inflation was anticipated in July, but the
main forces pushing up prices – higher energy prices and pandemic-
related supply bottlenecks – now appear to be stronger and more
persistent than expected. Core measures of inflation have also risen,
but by less than the CPI. The Bank now expects CPI inflation to be
elevated into next year, and ease back to around the 2 percent target by
late 2022. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations and
labour costs to ensure that the temporary forces pushing up prices do
not become embedded in ongoing inflation.

The Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity,
the economy continues to require considerable monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.
We remain committed to holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective
lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent
inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s projection, this
happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. In light of the
progress made in the economic recovery, the Governing Council has
decided to end quantitative easing and keep its overall holdings of
Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.

We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.

## Information notes

A market notice outlining details of the reinvestment phase will be

economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
