Good afternoon, Chair and committee members. This is my first
opportunity to address this committee since being appointed Governor of
the Bank of Canada, and I am very pleased to be here. We consider these
appearances to be an important part of our accountability to Canadians,
and I look forward to your questions and perspectives.

To begin, I’d like to review for the committee the Bank of Canada’s
actions since the start of the pandemic. I will also provide our
assessment of the progress toward economic recovery.

Through the pandemic, the Bank of Canada has had two overarching goals.
At the beginning of the crisis, our objective was to restore financial
market functioning and keep credit flowing. As market functioning
improved and Canadians began to come out of the first lockdown, our
focus shifted to providing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the
recovery, get Canadians back to work and bring inflation back to our 2
percent target.

Fifteen months ago, the extreme uncertainty caused by the virus and
associated lockdowns triggered an unprecedented dash for cash in
financial markets. With many more sellers of financial assets than
buyers, credit markets froze, threatening access to credit for
businesses and households. The Bank of Canada acted quickly and in
scale, providing liquidity and purchasing assets to support the
functioning of key Canadian financial markets. As a result, the Bank’s
balance sheet expanded rapidly as we purchased federal, provincial and
corporate bonds, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances and mortgage
bonds.

These new programs, 11 in all, were successful in restoring smooth
functioning across financial markets. Today, all but one of our
exceptional programs have been wound down or have ceased operations. The
one remaining program is our purchases of Government of Canada bonds,
also known as quantitative easing or QE, and I’ll come back to this in a
moment.

To provide monetary stimulus, the Bank lowered our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate
as far as we effectively could, to 0.25 percent, in the spring of 2020.
In the summer, we added exceptional forward guidance, committing to hold
our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate at its effective lower bound until slack is absorbed so
that we sustainably achieve our 2 percent inflation target. This
commitment was supplemented and reinforced by our QE program, which is
helping to lower interest rates across the yield curve, making it
cheaper for households and businesses to borrow.

In April 2021, the Bank published our revised outlook for the Canadian
economy in the _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR), and economic developments
since then have been broadly in line with that outlook. I would
highlight three key messages.

First, the economic recovery is making good progress. Canadian
households and businesses have shown impressive resilience to the
pandemic, and with more Canadians getting vaccinated, we anticipate
better times ahead.

Second, a complete recovery will still take some time. The third wave of
the virus has been a setback. It has strained health care systems in
some regions and has again hit sectors where physical distancing is
difficult. Important parts of the economy remain very weak, and too many
Canadians are still out of work.

Third, the Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to support Canadian
households and businesses through the full length of the recovery. For
working Canadians, a complete recovery means a healthy job market with
good opportunities. And that includes low-wage workers, women and young
people who have been hit hard by this pandemic. A complete recovery
means companies have confidence that the pandemic is over and are
investing to seize new business opportunities. And for both households
and businesses, a complete recovery means they can count on inflation
being sustainably at our 2 percent target. Let me elaborate on these
themes.

Following a sharp bounce back in economic activity in the fall and
winter, we’ve seen choppiness in growth again in the second quarter of
2021. Renewed lockdowns associated with the third wave of the pandemic
dampened economic activity early in the quarter, largely as anticipated.
The ebb and flow of the virus is mirrored by an ebb and flow of economic
growth. Recent jobs data show that workers in [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)-sensitive sectors
remain most affected, and the employment rate remains well below its
pre-pandemic level. Still, we have seen impressive resilience and
adaptability from Canadian households and businesses. They have found
new ways to shop, serve customers and work remotely.

Housing demand has been particularly strong, driven largely by the
desire for more living space and by low mortgage rates. All the while,
limited supply has led to a sharp increase in prices. As we explained in
our May _Financial System Review_ , it is important to understand that
the recent rapid increases in home prices are not normal. Our analysis
suggests that in some markets, price expectations have become
extrapolative—meaning people may be rushing to buy partly because they
expect prices to keep rising. This behaviour can exaggerate near-term
house price increases relative to fundamental demand. There are also
risks that some households may overstretch financially.

We welcome the revisions to the B-20 guideline issued by the Office of
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which altered the minimum
floor qualifying rate, as well as the parallel changes in the insured
market. These changes should help protect Canadians from overstretching.
The federal budget also included measures that will add supply. Overall,
we expect the housing market to be better balanced, but we will continue
to watch this area closely.

Looking more broadly at the economy as a whole, we forecast strong
consumption-led growth in the second half of this year as vaccinations
progress further and restrictions ease. Fiscal stimulus from the federal
and provincial governments will also make an important contribution to
growth. Strong foreign demand and higher commodity prices are expected
to drive exports and business investment, leading to a more broad-based
recovery. In our April MPR, we projected that the economy will grow by
around 6½ percent this year, about 3¾ percent in 2022 and 3¼ percent in
2023.

With this improved outlook, we are hopeful that the pandemic will end up
causing less labour market scarring and less lost capacity than we
earlier feared. We have therefore revised up our estimate of the
economy’s potential output. But I want to emphasize that considerable
uncertainty surrounds this estimate. As the recovery continues, we will
be paying attention to a broad spectrum of indicators of slack,
including a range of labour market measures.

Our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains grounded in our inflation-targeting
framework. The most recent data show that inflation remained above 3
percent in May. Inflation will likely remain near the top of our 1 to 3
percent inflation-control target range through the summer. This largely
reflects base-year effects combined with much stronger gasoline prices.
As these base-year effects fade, Governing Council expects the ongoing
excess supply in the economy to pull inflation back down. In our most
recent [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement last week, Governing Council judged that the
economy still needs extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain
committed to holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower
bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation
target is sustainably achieved. Based on our latest projection, this is
expected to happen sometime in the second half of 2022, although this
timing is unusually uncertain given the difficulties in assessing the
economy’s supply capacity.

Our forward guidance on our [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate continues to be reinforced and
supplemented by the Bank’s QE program. In April, we adjusted our weekly
purchases of Government of Canada bonds to a target of $3 billion, down
from the previous minimum of $4 billion. This adjustment reflects the
progress that we had already seen toward economic recovery.

With the end of most of our extraordinary programs, the Bank’s balance
sheet has shrunk to about $475 billion from a peak of about $575 billion
back in March. Below you will see a [chart][1] that shows the evolution
of the size and composition of our balance sheet. The Bank currently
holds more than $350 billion of Government of Canada bonds, representing
about 45 percent of the outstanding stock of nominal bonds.

Looking ahead, further adjustments to the pace of net purchases will be
guided by our ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of the
economic recovery. If the recovery evolves in line with or stronger than
our latest projection, the economy won’t need as much QE stimulus over
time. Further adjustments to our QE program will be gradual, and we will
be deliberate in both our assessment of incoming data and the
communication of our analysis.

We remain committed to providing the appropriate degree of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation
objective.

With that, let me stop and turn to you for questions.
