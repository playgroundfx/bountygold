## The road has been bumpy

In recent years, some economies have focused on managing immediate
crises at the expense of making longer-term adjustments that will raise
productivity and standards of living.

For instance, to get through short-term challenges, many emerging-market
economies have relied on strategies such as controlling capital and
intervening in foreign exchange markets.

These policies are important tools for coping with urgent economic
crises. But using these tools without an exit strategy works against the
long-term global goal of achieving an open system that supports a smooth
adjustment to shocks.

The international monetary and financial system could also come under
more pressure as advanced economies emerge from the pandemic more
quickly than others and begin removing monetary stimulus.
