## Why we reached out

Every five years, we renew our monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework with the
federal government. Before every renewal, we conduct research and talk
to experts about how effective the [current framework][1] has been at
keeping inflation low, stable and predictable.

This time, we expanded these discussions to include a broad range of
public interest groups and individual citizens.

We wanted to know what Canadians thought about the economy, our current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) framework and the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) being considered. We also
asked questions about the Bank’s other [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tools.

That’s why we conducted surveys, focus groups and round-table
discussions, and we invited written submissions from individuals and
groups.

### Why this matters

For the first time in 30 years, we’re comparing our current, flexible
inflation-targeting framework against a range of other [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/):

  * average inflation targeting
  * dual mandate (that targets inflation and employment)
  * nominal GDP targeting
  * price-level targeting

So we need to explore how any changes might affect households and
businesses. Conducting these consultations also allowed us ask
individual Canadians and groups about the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) actions we have taken
in extraordinary times, such as our [response to COVID‑19][2].

Talking to more people provides us with greater diversity of
perspectives and gives us an opportunity to better explain our work. It
is important that we understand what Canadians think and that Canadians
understand our objectives and how we achieve them. Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) works
best when it’s well understood.
