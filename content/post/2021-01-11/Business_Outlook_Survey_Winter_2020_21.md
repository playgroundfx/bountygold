More exporters than in the autumn survey were positive about their sales
outlook, but most are recovering from low levels of activity. They
expect foreign demand—particularly from the United States—to be
supportive. The majority of these firms are manufacturers (e.g.,
automobile, residential and commercial construction products), while
some are commodities exporters (e.g., energy) and a few are in the
services sector (e.g., transportation and logistics, technology and
software).

## Investment and hiring plans

The balance of opinion on investment in machinery and equipment moved up
and now sits well above zero, with firms across all regions pointing to
positive spending plans (Chart 4). This improvement reflects optimism
among firms that were not negatively affected by the pandemic as well as
recovering businesses’ expectations of a return to normal conditions.
Citing emerging strength in sales, many firms reported plans to expand
operations and boost productivity by investing in automation and
digitalization. They also plan to improve the customer-facing component
of their online business. While the overall outlook for investment has
improved, the impact of the pandemic on spending plans remains uneven
(Box 1). Several firms in high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) services, including tourism and
live entertainment, plan to hold back investment and spend less than
they did over the past 12 months.
