## The effects of COVID-19 have been deep and uneven

All Canadians are affected by COVID-19, but workers in some industries
have fared much worse than others.

The biggest job losses have been in service industries where physical
distancing is hardest, such as accommodation, food services, arts,
entertainment and recreation. And the workers in those industries—mostly
women and youth—tend to be low-income earners.

The second wave of the virus further hurt women and youth. Both groups
have seen their share of the long-term unemployed—people out of work for
at least 26 weeks—rise more quickly than others have.

As more people are vaccinated and normal life returns, the Canadian
economy will strengthen. But a complete recovery in the labour market
will take a long time.
