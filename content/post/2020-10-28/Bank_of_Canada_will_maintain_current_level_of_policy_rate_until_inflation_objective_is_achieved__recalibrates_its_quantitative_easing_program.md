The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at
the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent
and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its
extraordinary forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its
quantitative easing (QE) program. The Bank is reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ting the QE
program to shift purchases towards longer-term bonds, which have more
direct influence on the borrowing rates that are most important for
households and businesses. At the same time, total purchases will be
gradually reduced to at least $4 billion a week. The Governing Council
judges that, with these combined adjustments, the QE program is
providing at least as much monetary stimulus as before.

The global and Canadian economic outlooks have evolved largely as
anticipated in the July _Monetary Policy Report_ (MPR), with rapid
expansions as economies reopened giving way to slower growth, despite
considerable remaining excess capacity. Looking ahead, rising COVID-19
infections are likely to weigh on the economic outlook in many
countries, and growth will continue to rely heavily on [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.

In the United States, GDP growth rebounded strongly but appears to be
slowing considerably. China’s economic output is back to pre-pandemic
levels and its recovery continues to broaden. Emerging-market economies
have been hit harder, especially those with severe outbreaks. The
recovery in Europe is slowing amid mounting lockdowns. Overall, global
GDP is projected to contract by about 4 percent in 2020 before growing
by just over 4 ½ percent, on average, in 2021–22.

Oil prices remain about 30 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile,
non-energy commodity prices, on average, have more than fully recovered.
Despite continued low oil prices, the Canadian dollar has appreciated
since July, largely reflecting a broad-based depreciation of the US
dollar.

In Canada, the rebound in employment and GDP was stronger than expected
as the economy reopened through the summer. The economy is now
transitioning to a more moderate recuperation phase. In the fourth
quarter, growth is expected to slow markedly, due in part to rising
COVID-19 case numbers. The economic effects of the pandemic are highly
uneven across sectors and are particularly affecting low-income workers.
Recognizing these challenges, governments have extended and modified
business and income support programs.

After a decline of about 5 ½ percent in 2020, the Bank expects Canada’s
economy to grow by almost 4 percent on average in 2021 and 2022. Growth
will likely be choppy as domestic demand is influenced by the evolution
of the virus and its impact on consumer and business confidence.
Considering the likely long-lasting effects of the pandemic, the Bank
has revised down its estimate of Canada’s potential growth over the
projection horizon.

CPI inflation was at 0.5 percent in September and is expected to stay
below the Bank’s target band of 1 to 3 percent until early 2021, largely
due to low energy prices. Measures of core inflation are all below 2
percent, consistent with an economy where demand has fallen by more than
supply. Inflation is expected to remain below target throughout the
projection horizon.

As the economy recuperates, it will continue to require extraordinary
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. The Governing Council will hold the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is
absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved.
In our current projection, this does not happen until into 2023. The
Bank is continuing its QE program and reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ting it as described
above. The program will continue until the recovery is well underway. We
are committed to providing the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus needed to
support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
December 9, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR on January 20, 2021.
