The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary
forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced
and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which
is being adjusted to a target pace of $2 billion per week. This
adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank’s
increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook.

The global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic,
with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced
economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains
dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19
variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination
rates remain low.

Global GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then
moderate to about 4 ½ percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023.
This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank’s April
Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US
outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising
demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity
prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed
since April.

In Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second
quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and
easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the
second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6
percent in 2021 – a little slower than was expected in April – but has
revised up its 2022 forecast to 4 ½ percent and projects 3 ¼ percent
growth in 2023.

Consumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to
more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is
projected to ease back from [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs. Stronger international
demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and
foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment
will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we
expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong
gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will
vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire
workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns
and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates
of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly
uncertain.

CPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that
include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as
pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of
inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)
services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices
from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value
chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher
prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and
on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3
percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2
percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable
overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing
up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are
uncertain and will be monitored closely.

The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has
considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require
extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain committed to holding
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic
slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably
achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens sometime in the
second half of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this
commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions
regarding further adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be
guided by Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and
durability of the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate
degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery and achieve
the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
September 8, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR on October 27, 2021.
