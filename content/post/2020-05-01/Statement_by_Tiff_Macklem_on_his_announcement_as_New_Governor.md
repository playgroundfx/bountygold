To the Minister of Finance and Board of Directors of the Bank, thank you
for selecting me as the tenth Governor of the Bank of Canada. It is a
privilege and an honour.

I am looking forward to returning to the Bank and working alongside the
distinguished members of the Governing Council and the Bank’s first-rate
staff. The Bank’s employees have always been its greatest strength, and
thanks to their efforts, the institution is considered as one of the
world’s leading and trusted central banks. That reputation has only been
enhanced by the Bank’s decisive and unprecedented response to the
COVID-19 crisis, led by Governor Poloz and Senior Deputy Governor
Wilkins. The Bank’s actions are helping to protect Canada’s economy and
its financial system from lasting damage.

And while the events of the past several weeks have been all-consuming,
the term of a Governor is seven years. And looking over the entirety of
Governor Poloz’s term, his contributions to Canada have been
outstanding. He was appointed in 2013, when the Canadian and global
economies were still dealing with the after-effects of the Global
Financial Crisis. A year and a half later, he and his team had to manage
the effects of an oil shock. Throughout his seven years, with several
setbacks along the way, Governor Poloz has worked to bring the economy
back home; with inflation on target at the 2 per cent target and
unemployment at a forty-year low, as recently as January. Over the past
couple of months, Canadians have benefitted from the leadership of
Governor Poloz in dealing with the economic effects of COVID-19.

The Bank of Canada promotes the wellbeing of Canadians through its four
core [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/): the independent conduct of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/); the
provision of secure, reliable bank notes; the promotion of a safe and
efficient financial system; and by providing banking services to the
Government of Canada. I’m looking forward to building on the fine
standard that Governor Poloz, his team, and our predecessors have
provided, so that we can continue to fulfil the mandate set out in the
Bank of Canada Act.

To all Canadians, I pledge to do all I can to live up to the very high
standards of those who have come before me.

Now my colleagues and I will be glad to take questions.
