The Directors of the Bank of Canada, appointed under Section 9 of the
Bank of Canada Act, today announced that they have appointed [Tiff
Macklem][1] as Governor of the Bank of Canada for a seven-year term,
effective 3 June 2020. Mr. Macklem will succeed Stephen S. Poloz, who is
leaving the Bank of Canada on 2 June 2020.

"After pursuing an exhaustive domestic and international selection
process for this crucial role, I'm delighted to say that Tiff Macklem
has the exceptional qualities to fulfil this role,” said Claire Kennedy,
Chair of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. "Tiff has deep
knowledge of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and financial stability issues, a proven
crisis management track record, and extensive senior leadership
experience. We are confident Tiff will make an outstanding contribution
to promoting the economic and financial welfare of Canada, and to
upholding the Bank’s exemplary reputation as a leading central bank.”

A native of Montréal, Quebec, Mr. Macklem has been Dean of the Rotman
School of Management at the University of Toronto since July 2014. Prior
to that, he served as the Senior Deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada
between July 2010 and May 2014. Before his appointment as Senior Deputy
Governor, Mr. Macklem was Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of
Finance, serving as Canada's representative at the G7, G20 and Financial
Stability Board. Mr. Macklem first joined the Bank in 1984 and occupied
increasingly senior positions until he was appointed Advisor to the
Governor in August 2003. In 2003-4, he was seconded to the Department of
Finance, before returning to the Bank as Deputy Governor in December
2004. Mr. Macklem graduated from Queen's University in 1983 with a
bachelor's degree in economics, and completed a master’s degree and a
PhD in economics from the University of Western Ontario.

On behalf of the directors, Ms. Kennedy thanked Governor Poloz for his
dedicated service and his leadership in promoting the economic and
financial well being of Canada throughout his tenure. She also thanked
him for the important contributions he has made to the global [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
dialogue, which are being brought to bear in the current challenging
