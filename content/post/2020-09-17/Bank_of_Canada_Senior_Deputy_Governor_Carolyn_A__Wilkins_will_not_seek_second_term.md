The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada announced today that Senior
Deputy Governor Carolyn A. Wilkins informed them that she will not seek
a second term. Her current term runs to May 1, 2021. The Board will
initiate a search process to select her successor.

“It has been a great honour and privilege to serve Canadians in this
role, and throughout my 20 years at the Bank,” Senior Deputy Governor
Wilkins said. “My time at the Bank has been the most fulfilling period
of my career – a testament to the many dedicated and talented
colleagues, both at home and abroad, that I have been fortunate to work
with.”

The Senior Deputy Governor thanked past and present members of the
Bank’s Board of Directors, former Governor Stephen Poloz, and current
Governor Tiff Macklem for the confidence that they have shown in her
over the years.

“Building and carrying out a shared vision for the Bank with Governor
Poloz has been a professional highlight. I’ve also enjoyed working
closely again with Governor Macklem. The Bank is in good hands.”

The Board’s lead independent director, Claire Kennedy, said the Senior
Deputy Governor has served the Bank and Canadians with distinction.
“Through her leadership and innovative approach to the role of Senior
Deputy Governor, Carolyn has made an invaluable contribution to the
economic and financial welfare of all Canadians. Most recently, she led
the development and implementation of the Bank’s asset purchase
programs. These programs have helped Canadians bridge a very difficult
period and are supporting the economic recovery.”
