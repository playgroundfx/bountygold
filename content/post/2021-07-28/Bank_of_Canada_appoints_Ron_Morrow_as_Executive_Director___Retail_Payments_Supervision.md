The Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of [Ron Morrow][1] as
Executive Director – Retail Payments Supervision, effective August 9,
2021.

This executive-level position has been created, with endorsement from
the Bank’s Board of Directors, to support the Bank’s [new mandate][2] to
supervise retail payment service providers (PSPs), as per the [_Retail
Payment Activities Act_][3]. Under this _Act_ , which was approved by
Parliament on June 29, 2021, the Bank will be responsible for
supervising PSPs to protect end users and help ensure the safety and
reliability of PSP services. As per the _Act_ , the Bank will maintain a
public registry of all regulated payment service providers and a regular
reporting framework. Bank of Canada supervision will also ensure that
PSPs mitigate their operational risk and safeguard end-user funds.

Reporting directly to the Governor, Mr. Morrow will lead the design and
implementation of the Retail Payments Supervision (RPS) Framework,
including ongoing consultations on the Bank’s supervisory role as
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s are developed. He will build the leadership team tasked with
fulfilling this new mandate and oversee planning and execution of risk
monitoring of PSPs. The Executive Director role will also act as an
independent reviewer of enforcement actions initiated by RPS staff and
advise the Governor of the Bank of Canada on the evolution of risks
related to PSPs and the retail payments landscape.

“This new mandate for the Bank is an important responsibility,” said
Governor Macklem. “The payments eco-system in Canada and globally is
evolving rapidly, with innovative new [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and many new participants.
Ron’s expertise, experience and leadership will ensure that we undertake
this new role on behalf of Canadians with the same rigour, dedication
and professionalism that the Bank applies to all its mandated
responsibilities.”

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Mr. Morrow first joined the Bank in 1992
and has worked in several different areas across the Bank’s monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), financial stability, and [funds management](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/a-kind-of-misunderstanding-about-funds-management1/) [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/). In 2010, he
became Managing Director of the Funds Management and Banking Department,
then Managing Director of the Financial Stability Department in 2013.
Mr. Morrow became an Advisor to the Governor in 2018, focusing on
advancing the Bank’s strategic objectives related to retail payments,
financial market infrastructure issues, and the efficiency of the
Canadian financial system. Mr. Morrow also represented the Bank on the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and chairs the Bank’s Pension
Fund Investment Committee.

Mr. Morrow holds an Honours Bachelor of Arts Degree in economics, with a
