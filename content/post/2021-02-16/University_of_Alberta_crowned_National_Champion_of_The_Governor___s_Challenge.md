The University of Alberta has won the Bank of Canada’s sixth annual
Governor’s Challenge, a national student competition in which teams
simulate the role of [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) to the Bank’s Governing Council. The
winners were announced following the final round on Saturday, February
13.

[Governor Tiff Macklem][1] congratulated all the participants on their
grasp of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-making process and encouraged them to
consider a future career in the public service. “This is my first year
taking part in the Governor’s Challenge, and I was thoroughly impressed
with the calibre of presentations made by this next generation of bright
economic minds,” he said. “You have so much to offer our country and I
hope you consider harnessing your enthusiasm and dedication into a
career that contributes to the economic well-being of Canadians.”

The Governor’s Challenge invites undergraduate students in economics and
finance to develop a deeper understanding of the Canadian economy and
the Bank’s role in it. Since the first competition, 39 participants have
joined the Bank – one measure of the initiative’s success.

Five teams competed in the final round, each one giving a virtual
presentation on the economic outlook for Canada and making a monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) recommendation to a panel of senior central bank officials.

The judges for the final round were [Eric Santor][2] and [Sharon
Kozicki][3], Advisors to the Bank of Canada Governor, and [Sylvain
Leduc][4], Executive Vice President and Director of Economic Research,
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
