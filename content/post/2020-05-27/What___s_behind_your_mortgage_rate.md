It looked like a puzzle: As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, central
banks—including the Bank of Canada—quickly cut interest rates to cushion
the blow. But rates on new mortgages didn’t decline much, and some
actually went up. Why?

Remember that your lender’s funding cost determines most of the mortgage
rate. The cost of funding jumped in the early days of the pandemic as
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s became nervous. Many simply wanted to hold on to their cash
given how uncertain everything was. So, the funding that is normally
easy for lenders to get slowed to a trickle. This drove up the funding
cost, even as the Bank of Canada’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate fell.

The Bank of Canada has taken [many steps][1] to help financial markets
work better during the pandemic, along with the federal government and
other public authorities. The goal is to ease strains in funding
markets, so lenders can keep supplying credit to households and
businesses.

These steps include launching programs to make sure lenders can access
the funding they need. As a result of these actions, funding costs fell
and some mortgage rates on new loans started to decline.

Keep in mind: existing mortgages didn’t become more expensive during the
pandemic. They either have an interest rate that is fixed until its next
renewal, or a variable interest rate that declined along with the Bank
of Canada [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) rate.
