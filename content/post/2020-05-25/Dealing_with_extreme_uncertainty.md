##  Risk management and COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic brings a whole new set of risks and uncertainties.

How the labour market, business investment, and household, government
and corporate debt evolve will depend on how long it takes to defeat the
virus. And thatâ€™s the greatest uncertainty of all.

In the face of this uncertainty, our priorities are helping people and
the economy and sticking with our inflation target. We do this by laying
the foundation for a strong recovery:

  * We have cut interest rates to as low as they could go.
  * We have taken steps to support the financial system, so households and businesses can access credit and governments can secure funding for key relief programs.

Some worry that our measures will cause inflation down the road.
However, the bigger risk is deflation, or falling prices, which is our
immediate concern.

The extreme uncertainty from COVID-19 adds urgency to research that we
and other central banks are doing to update and refine our risk
management approach.
