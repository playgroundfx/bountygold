The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary
forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced
and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which
is being maintained at a target pace of $2 billion per week.

The global economic recovery continued through the second quarter, led
by strong US growth, and had solid momentum heading into the third
quarter. However, supply chain disruptions are restraining activity in
some sectors and rising cases of COVID-19 in many regions pose a risk to
the strength of the global recovery. Financial conditions remain highly
accommodative.

In Canada, GDP contracted by about 1 percent in the second quarter,
weaker than anticipated in the Bank’s July _Monetary Policy Report_
(MPR). This largely reflects a contraction in exports, due in part to
supply chain disruptions, especially in the auto sector. Housing market
activity pulled back from recent high levels, largely as expected.
Consumption, business investment and government spending all contributed
positively to growth, with domestic demand growing at more than 3
percent. Employment rebounded through June and July, with hard-to-
distance sectors hiring as public health restrictions eased. This is
reducing unevenness in the labour market, although considerable slack
remains and some groups – particularly low-wage workers – are still
disproportionately affected. The Bank continues to expect the economy to
strengthen in the second half of 2021, although the fourth wave of
COVID-19 infections and ongoing supply bottlenecks could weigh on the
recovery.

CPI inflation remains above 3 percent as expected, boosted by base-year
effects, gasoline prices, and pandemic-related supply bottlenecks. These
factors pushing up inflation are expected to be transitory, but their
persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely.
Wage increases have been moderate to date, and medium-term inflation
expectations remain well-anchored. Core measures of inflation have
risen, but by less than the CPI.

The Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has
considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require
extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support. We remain committed to holding
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic
slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably
achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens in the second half
of 2022. The Bank's QE program continues to reinforce this commitment
and keep interest rates low across the yield curve. Decisions regarding
future adjustments to the pace of net bond purchases will be guided by
Governing Council's ongoing assessment of the strength and durability of
the recovery. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the
inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
October 27, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR at the same time.
