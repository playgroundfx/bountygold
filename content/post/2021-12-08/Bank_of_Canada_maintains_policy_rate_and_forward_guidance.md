The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank’s extraordinary forward guidance
on the path for the overnight rate is being maintained. The Bank is
continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of
Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.

The global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. Economic growth in the United States has accelerated, led by
consumption, while growth in some other regions is moderating after a
strong third quarter. Inflation has increased further in many countries,
reflecting strong demand for goods amid ongoing supply disruptions. The
new Omicron COVID-19 variant has prompted a tightening of travel
restrictions in many countries and a decline in oil prices, and has
injected renewed uncertainty. Accommodative financial conditions are
still supporting economic activity.

Canada’s economy grew by about 5½ percent in the third quarter, as
expected. Together with a downward revision to the second quarter, this
brings the level of GDP to about 1½ percent below its level in the last
quarter of 2019, before the pandemic began. Third-quarter growth was led
by a rebound in consumption, particularly services, as restrictions were
further eased and higher vaccination rates improved confidence.
Persistent supply bottlenecks continued to inhibit growth in other
components of GDP, including non-commodity exports and business
investment.

Recent economic indicators suggest the economy had considerable momentum
into the fourth quarter. This includes broad-based job gains in recent
months that have brought the employment rate essentially back to its
pre-pandemic level.  Job vacancies remain elevated and wage growth has
also picked up. Housing activity had been moderating, but appears to be
regaining strength, notably in resales. The devastating floods in
British Columbia and uncertainties arising from the Omicron variant
could weigh on growth by compounding supply chain disruptions and
reducing demand for some services.

CPI inflation is elevated and the impact of global supply constraints is
feeding through to a broader range of goods prices. The effects of these
constraints on prices will likely take some time to work their way
through, given existing supply backlogs. Gasoline prices, which had been
a major factor pushing up CPI inflation, have recently declined.
Meanwhile, core measures of inflation are little changed since
September. The Bank continues to expect CPI inflation to remain elevated
in the first half of 2022 and ease back towards 2 percent in the second
half of the year. The Bank is closely watching inflation expectations
and labour costs to ensure that the forces pushing up prices do not
become embedded in ongoing inflation.

The Governing Council judges that in view of ongoing excess capacity,
the economy continues to require considerable monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) support.
We remain committed to holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the effective
lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent
inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s October
projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. We
will provide the appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to
support the recovery and achieve the inflation target.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
January 26, 2022. The Bank will publish its full outlook for the economy
and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the Monetary Policy
Report at the same time.
