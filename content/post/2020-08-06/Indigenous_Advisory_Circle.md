### Marie-Louise Perron

** Chair, Ottawa Region Métis Council **

Marie-Louise Perron was born on her grandfather’s land in Saskatchewan.
She is a descendant of Red River Métis and early French newcomers.

Through different careers, from high school teacher to visual artist,
author, archivist and public servant, she has maintained the
storytelling tradition of her people. She has presented and published,
in both English and French, for national and international audiences, on
subjects including the French/Métis songs and stories of the Perron-
Ladéroute-Marion-St. Arnaud families, instruction on tracing one's
family [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and the value of archives to society.

Now retired, Marie-Louise pursues [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) and genealogical research,
offers workshops on tracing Indigenous ancestry, studies traditional
violin, and participates in many styles of storytelling, including video
and digital. An artist in watercolours, mixed media on canvas and
photography, she has participated in multiple exhibitions. Her work can
be found in private and institutional collections across Canada.

Marie-Louise has been an active member of the Métis community for many
years, including on the organizing committee for the award-winning
_Walking With Our Sisters_ Memorial Installation in Ottawa.
