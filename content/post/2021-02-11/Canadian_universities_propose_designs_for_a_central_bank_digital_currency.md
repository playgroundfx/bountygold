The Bank of Canada is researching potential system designs and business
models for a digital currency that, like a banknote, would be widely
accessible, secure and denominated in Canadian dollars. To solicit
additional ideas, the Bank engaged three independent project teams in

Bank. All three design proposals were published today in reports from:

While the Bank is ramping up contingency planning for a central bank
digital currency, it currently has no plans to issue one. The proposed
designs are therefore not intended to be adopted by the Bank. Rather,
the Bank will use these reports to inform its thinking and advance
public conversation on a central bank digital currency design.
