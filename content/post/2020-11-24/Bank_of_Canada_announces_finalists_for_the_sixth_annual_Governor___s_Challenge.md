## Notes for editors

  * The first round of this year’s competition took place November 17-18, 2020, with presentations delivered by video conference. More than 100 students from 22 Canadian universities participated. The final round will take place Saturday, February 13, 2021, by video conference.
  * Working in teams, students provided analysis and forecasts on developments in the economy. They then presented a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) recommendation to keep inflation low and stable, in line with the Bank’s inflation target of 2 per cent. The judges evaluated teams on the substance of their analysis, the quality of their presentation and evidence of strong teamwork.
  * The team from the [University of British Columbia][2] won last year’s competition.
