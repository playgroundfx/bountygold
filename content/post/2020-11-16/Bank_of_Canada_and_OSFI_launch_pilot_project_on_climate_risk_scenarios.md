The Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) today announced plans for a pilot project to use
climate-change scenarios to better understand the risks to the financial
system related to a transition to a low-carbon economy. A small group of
institutions from the banking and insurance sectors will participate
voluntarily in the project.

Scenario analysis is a useful tool for identifying potential risks in an
environment of considerable uncertainty. Climate-change scenarios
related to a transition to a low-carbon economy explore different
pathways for emissions reductions – driven by changes in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
technology, and consumer and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) preferences – and their
implications for the economy and financial system.

The project aims to:

  * build the climate scenario analysis capability of authorities and financial institutions, and support the Canadian financial sector in enhancing the disclosure of climate-related risks
  * increase authorities’ and financial institutions’ understanding of the financial sector’s potential exposure to risks associated with a transition to a low-carbon economy
  * improve authorities’ understanding of financial institutions’ governance and risk-management practices around climate-related risks and opportunities

“Climate change is a major challenge for the economy, and it is
accelerating. We need to accelerate our work to understand the
implications for the economy and the financial system,” said Bank of
Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. “This project will generate valuable
lessons for assessing and managing climate risks. With the private
sector’s help, we will be able to combine climate analysis with economic
and financial data to ensure we have the best information possible to
fulfill our mandate.”

“Everyone, including the financial sector, will have to adjust to the
new reality of climate change. The shape of that new reality will depend
on many complex issues and on much that remains uncertain,” said Jeremy
Rudin, Superintendent of OSFI. “This pilot project will allow us to
refine our focus on the prudential aspects of climate change.”

Building on [previous work][1] on climate-change scenarios for the
global economy, the Bank and OSFI will first develop a set of climate-
change scenarios that are relevant for Canada. Using these scenarios,
participants will explore the potential risk exposures of their balance
sheets. The Bank and OSFI will publish a report, planned for the end of
2021, sharing details on the specific scenarios, methodology,
assumptions and key sensitivities.

This project is not intended to serve as an assessment of individual
financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related risks or the broader
financial sector’s resilience to transition risks. Further, the
selection of project participants is not an endorsement of their current
approaches to the management or disclosure of climate risks.

The following financial institutions will participate in the project:

  * Intact Financial Corporation
  * Manulife
  * Royal Bank of Canada
  * Sun Life Financial
  * TD Bank Group
  * The Co-operators Group Limited
