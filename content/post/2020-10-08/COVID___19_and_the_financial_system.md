## The financial system is helping Canadians, but risks remain

The impact of the pandemic on lives and livelihoods is beyond anything
we’ve experienced in our lifetimes.

Along with actions by the government and the Bank of Canada, a resilient
financial system is helping Canadians through the COVID‑19 crisis. But
it will be a long, slow climb to get everybody back to work. A full
recovery from the crisis will take time, and many risks remain.

The longer the pandemic threatens jobs and incomes, the greater the risk
of trouble for households with a lot of debt. Government support
programs have bridged the financial gaps for people through the crisis,
and lenders have been flexible about payments. The six-month deferrals
that financial institutions offered are ending, though, so the next few
months will be crucial.

Businesses are also finding it hard to cover debt payments with lower
revenues, especially those in service industries such as restaurants and
hotels. This too could become a bigger issue the longer the recovery
takes.
