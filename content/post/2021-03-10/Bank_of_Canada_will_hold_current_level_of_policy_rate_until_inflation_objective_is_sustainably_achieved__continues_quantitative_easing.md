The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the
effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and
the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary
forward guidance, reinforced and supplemented by its quantitative easing
(QE) program, which continues at its current pace of at least $4 billion
per week.

The global economy is recovering from the economic effects of COVID-19,
albeit with ongoing unevenness across regions and sectors. The US
economic recovery appears to be gaining momentum as virus infections
decline and fiscal support boosts incomes and consumption. New fiscal
stimulus will increase US consumption and output growth further. Global
yield curves have steepened, largely reflecting the improved US growth
outlook, but global financial conditions remain highly accommodative.
Oil and other commodity prices have risen. The Canadian dollar has been
relatively stable against the US dollar, but has appreciated against
most other currencies.

In Canada, the economy is proving to be more resilient than anticipated
to the second wave of the virus and the associated containment measures.
Although activity in hard-to-distance sectors continues to be held back,
recent data point to continued recovery in the rest of the economy. GDP
grew 9.6% in the final quarter of 2020, led by strong inventory
accumulation. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 is now expected to
be positive, rather than the contraction forecast in January. Consumers
and businesses are adapting to containment measures, and housing market
activity has been much stronger than expected. Improving foreign demand
and higher commodity prices have also brightened the prospects for
exports and business investment.

Despite the stronger near-term outlook, there is still considerable
economic slack and a great deal of uncertainty about the evolution of
the virus and the path of economic growth. The labour market is a long
way from recovery, with employment still well below pre-COVID levels.
Low-wage workers, young people and women have borne the brunt of the job
losses. The spread of more transmissible variants of the virus poses the
largest downside risk to activity, as localized outbreaks and
restrictions could restrain growth and add choppiness to the recovery.

CPI inflation is near the bottom of the 1-3 percent target band but is
likely to move temporarily to around the top of the band in the next few
months. The expected rise in CPI inflation reflects base-year effects
from deep price declines in some goods and services at the outset of the
crisis a year ago, combined with higher gasoline prices pushed up by the
recent run-up in oil prices. CPI inflation is then expected to moderate
as base-year effects dissipate and excess capacity continues to exert
downward pressure. Measures of core inflation currently range from 1.3
to 2 percent.

While economic prospects have improved, the Governing Council judges
that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
support. We remain committed to holding the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) interest rate at the
effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2
percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s January
projection, this does not happen until into 2023. To reinforce this
commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank
will continue its QE program until the recovery is well underway.  As
the Governing Council continues to gain confidence in the strength of
the recovery, the pace of net purchases of Government of Canada bonds
will be adjusted as required. We will continue to provide the
appropriate degree of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus to support the recovery
and achieve the inflation objective.

## Information note

The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is
April 21, 2021. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the
economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be
published in the MPR at the same time.
